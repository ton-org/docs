This page is a placeholder, a stub. It's here to help visualize the new structure, but it is temporarily devoid of content.

- AI assistant
- AI-augmented search
- Code blocks with "Explain" button
- Ability to copy pages as Markdown or to open them in common online LLM apps
- MCP server provided by Mintlify
- Something outside of documentation, such as AI bots for TON (Ethena?)
- etc.
