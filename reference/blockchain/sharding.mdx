<Aside>
  Disambiguation: this page describes the sharding done by the blockchain nodes themselves and not the contract-level sharding, which is a common pattern when building smart contracts. For the latter, see the [Contract-level sharding](/build/on-chain/patterns/sharding) page.

This page is a placeholder, a stub. It's here to help visualize the new structure, but it is temporarily devoid of content.
