This section introduces the core concepts of the TON Blockchain. It explains the fundamental building blocks of the system, including data structures, transaction flow, consensus mechanisms, and network protocols.

<Aside>
  The material here provides the foundation for developers, researchers, and anyone who wants to understand low-level TON’s architecture.

## Core Data Structures & Addressing

- **[Cells](/ton/cells)** – A cell is the fundamental data structure in TON blockchain used to store all information on-chain. Each cell can store up to 1023 bits of data and maintain up to 4 references to other cells.
- **[Addresses](/ton/addresses)** –  Addresses are unique identifiers for smart contracts (including wallets). Every entity on TON is a smart contract with its own address.
- **[Account Statuses](/ton/statuses)** – The four possible states an account can exist in on the TON blockchain.

## Transaction Processing

- **[Messages and Transactions](/ton/transaction)** – TON is message-driven: all interactions between accounts are handled through internal and external messages, which form transactions.
- **[Execution Phases and Fees](/ton/phases-and-fees)** – How TON processes a transaction through the Storage, Credit, Compute, Action, and Bounce phases, while applying fees at each step.
- **[Precompiled Contracts](/ton/precompiled)** – A feature of TON that heavily optimizes gas usage for frequently invoked contracts.

## Network Architecture

- **[Blockchain Sharding](/ton/shards)** – TON’s horizontal scaling model, where every workchain is divided into multiple shardchains that can process transactions in parallel.
- **[Blockchain Configuration](/ton/config)** – Dynamically updated configuration of the blockchain∆ that is a native TON account.
- **[Network Protocols](/ton/network)** – TON’s communication stack, including ADNL for peer discovery, RLDP for reliable data transfer, and DHT for distributed lookups.
- **[Blocks](/ton/)** – A block in TON contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, forming the blockchain.

## Validation & Security

- **[Proofs](/ton/proofs)** – Applicability of Merkle proofs, natively supported by TON Blockchain.
- **[Consensus](/ton/consensus)** – TON’s Catchain consensus protocol, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm that ensures validators reach agreement on blocks in the presence of faulty or malicious participants.

## Technical Whitepapers

- **[Cells](/ton/cells/boc)** – A cell is the fundamental data structure in TON blockchain used to store all information on-chain. Each cell can store up to 1023 bits of data and maintain up to 4 references to other cells.
- **[Addresses](/ton/addresses/addresses-general-info)** – Addresses are unique identifiers for smart contracts (including wallets). Every entity on TON is a smart contract with its own address.
- **[Blocks](/ton/tblkch)** – A block in TON contains transaction data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, forming the blockchain
- **[TVM Whitepaper](/ton/tvm)** – The original specification of the TON Virtual Machine, the execution engine for all smart contracts.
