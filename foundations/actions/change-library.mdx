title: "Change library"
---

Change a library is one of the actions that a smart contract can perform during the [action phase](/foundations/phases#action-phase). It modifies the collection of this smart contract libraries by adding or removing library. It can get into the [out action list](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/5c0349110bb03dd3a241689f2ab334ae1a554ffb/crypto/block/block.tlb#L411) by:

- The [`SETLIBCODE`](/tvm/instructions#fb06-setlibcode) instruction.
- The [`CHANGELIB`](/tvm/instructions#fb07-changelib) instruction.
- The [`POPCTR`](/tvm/instructions#ed5-popctr) instruction.

The change library action consists of:

- a 7-bit bitmask `mode` specifying the way of changing the library;
- a ref to a cell containing the new library code or the hash of this code as an unsigned 256-bit integer.

## Modes

The `mode` can have the following values that can be combined together:

| Mode value | Convenient name     | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------: | :------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        `0` | `RemoveLibrary`     | Default mode. The library is actually removed if it was previously present in the collection (if not, this action does nothing).                |
|       `+1` | `AddPrivateLibrary` | The library is added as a private library.                                                                                                      |
|       `+2` | `AddPublicLibrary`  | The library is added as a public library and becomes available to all smart contracts if the current smart contract resides in the masterchain. |
|      `+16` | `BounceOnFail`      | Bounces the transaction if the action fails.                                                                                                    |

The other `mode` values are invalid and lead to an error. Simultaneous usage of the `AddPrivateLibrary` and  `AddPublicLibrary` modes also leads to an error. If the library was present in the collection before, its public/private status is changed according to the `mode`.

## Serialization

```tlb
libref_hash$0 lib_hash:bits256 = LibRef;
libref_ref$1 library:^Cell = LibRef;
action_change_library#26fa1dd4 mode:(## 7)
    libref:LibRef = OutAction;
```
