A trace is a set of messages and transactions produced by a single external message.

Each _i-th_ transaction in the trace is triggered by a message sent during the action phase of some earlier _j-th_ transaction, where _j \< i_.

All messages and transactions in the trace are ordered by their [logical time (lt)](/foundations/whitepapers/tblkch#1-4-1-logical-time), reflecting their logical dependencies. The diagram shows transactions on independent accounts, each triggered by an incoming message, with `lt` values indicated for every message.

  Transactions may be triggered not only by external messages but also by [tick-tock](/foundations/whitepapers/tblkch#4-2-4-kinds-of-transactions) events, commonly used within internal TON Blockchain contracts, such as governance or elector contracts.

  **Example:** [Tick-tock initiated trace](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/c386d3f7cc797aeb4d126a17da9055e47e79a1bce73262e8d665d94636f97bdc).

## Using traces in Tonviewer

In [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/), traces are visualized as [directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), where _transactions are nodes_ and _messages are edges_, showing the full sequence of account state changes triggered by a single external message.

### Tracing operations

Traces show the execution flow of an operation, such as a Jetton or NFT transfer, illustrating how transactions and messages connect to produce the final result. Each trace is an automatically generated tree of related transactions derived from message propagation.

**Example**

The NFT transfer illustrates a single operation that consists of **three transactions**, each triggered by messages. To learn how to read traces, follow [this article](/ecosystem/explorers/tonviewer#steps-to-analyze-an-operation).

## Access using API

To fetch transaction data, use the [`GET /traces`](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/v3/actions-and-traces/list-actions-by-filters-tx-msg-trace) endpoint.
This method returns all transactions related to a given operation without requiring individual parsing.
