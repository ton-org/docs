import { Aside } from '/snippets/aside.jsx';

When an event occurs on an account in The Open Network (TON) blockchain, it triggers a **transaction**.
The most common event is receiving a message, but other events like `tick-tock`, `merge`, and `split` can also initiate transactions.

Each transaction consists of up to five phases:

1. **Storage phase**: calculates storage fees for the contract based on the space it occupies in the blockchain state.
1. **Credit phase**: updates the contract balance by accounting for incoming message values and storage fees.
1. **Compute phase**: executes the contract code on the TON Virtual Machine (TVM). The result includes `exit_code`, `actions`, `gas_details`, `new_storage`, and other data.
1. **Action phase**: processes actions from the compute phase if it succeeds.\
   Actions may include sending messages, updating contract code, or modifying libraries. If an action fails (for example, due to a lack of funds), the transaction may revert or skip the action, depending on its mode. For example, `mode = 0, flag = 2` means that any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase are ignored.
1. **Bounce phase**: If the compute phase ends with an error and the inbound message has the bounce flag set, this phase generates a bounce message. If the send\_msg action failed and it had the +16 flag set, then the bounce phase will also be triggered.

## Fee deduction sequence

1. Import fee (before the first phase)
1. Storage fee (storage phase)
1. Gas fee (compute phase)
1. Action fee + forward fee (action phase)
1. Additional forward fees (bounce phase)

## Storage phase

Cannot be skipped.

In this phase, the blockchain processes fees related to the account's persistent storage. Let's start by looking at the TL-B schema:

```tlb
tr_phase_storage$_ storage_fees_collected:Grams
  storage_fees_due:(Maybe Grams)
  status_change:AccStatusChange
  = TrStoragePhase;
```

The `storage_fees_due` field is of type `Maybe` because it is only present when the account has **insufficient balance** to cover the storage fees. When the account has enough funds, this field is omitted.

> Note: Grams are unsigned integers, so account balances cannot be negative.

The `AccStatusChange` field indicates whether the account's status changed during this phase. For example, see [account status variety](/foundations/statuses#status-variety).

## Credit phase

Cannot be skipped.

This phase is relatively small and straightforward.
The main logic of this phase is to **credit the contract’s balance** with the remaining value from the incoming message.

The credit phase is serialized in TL-B as follows:

```tlb
tr_phase_credit$_ due_fees_collected:(Maybe Grams)
  credit:CurrencyCollection = TrCreditPhase;
```

This phase consists of the following two fields:

| Field                | Type                 | Description                                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `due_fees_collected` | `Maybe Grams`        | Amount of previously due storage fees collected (present only if storage fees were due and collected in this phase). |
| `credit`             | `CurrencyCollection` | The amount credited to the account as a result of receiving the incoming message.                                    |

## Compute phase

The **compute phase** is one of the most complex stages of a transaction. This is where the smart contract code, stored in the account’s state, is executed.

Unlike previous phases, the TL-B definition for the compute phase includes multiple variants.

```tlb
tr_phase_compute_skipped$0 reason:ComputeSkipReason
  = TrComputePhase;
tr_phase_compute_vm$1 success:Bool msg_state_used:Bool
  account_activated:Bool gas_fees:Grams
  ^[ gas_used:(VarUInteger 7)
  gas_limit:(VarUInteger 7) gas_credit:(Maybe (VarUInteger 3))
  mode:int8 exit_code:int32 exit_arg:(Maybe int32)
  vm_steps:uint32
  vm_init_state_hash:bits256 vm_final_state_hash:bits256 ]
  = TrComputePhase;
cskip_no_state$00 = ComputeSkipReason;
cskip_bad_state$01 = ComputeSkipReason;
cskip_no_gas$10 = ComputeSkipReason;
cskip_suspended$110 = ComputeSkipReason;
```

### When the compute phase is skipped

To start, note that the compute phase can be **skipped** entirely. In that case, the reason for skipping is explicitly recorded and can be one of the following:

| Skip reason       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cskip_no_state`  | The smart contract has no [state](/foundations/statuses#status-variety) and, therefore, no code, so execution is not possible.                                                                                          |
| `cskip_bad_state` | Raised in two cases: when the `fixed_prefix_length` [field has an invalid value][fixed_prefix_length] or when the `StateInit` provided in the incoming message [does not match the account’s address][account_address]. |
| `cskip_no_gas`    | The incoming message did not provide enough TON to cover the gas required to execute the smart contract.                                                                                                                |
| `cskip_suspended` | The address is suspended; execution is disabled (used to limit early miner accounts).                                                                                                                                   |

  The `fixed_prefix_length` field can be used to specify a fixed prefix for the account address, ensuring that the account resides in a specific shard.
  This topic is outside the scope of this guide, but more information is available in [Shards page](/foundations/shards).

## Action phase

Once the smart contract code has finished executing, the **Action phase** begins. If any actions were created during the compute phase, they are processed at this stage.

There are precisely 4 types of actions in TON:

```tlb
action_send_msg#0ec3c86d mode:(## 8)
  out_msg:^(MessageRelaxed Any) = OutAction;
action_set_code#ad4de08e new_code:^Cell = OutAction;
action_reserve_currency#36e6b809 mode:(## 8)
  currency:CurrencyCollection = OutAction;
libref_hash$0 lib_hash:bits256 = LibRef;
libref_ref$1 library:^Cell = LibRef;
action_change_library#26fa1dd4 mode:(## 7)
  libref:LibRef = OutAction;
```

| Type                      | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `action_send_msg`         | Sends a message.                                                                           |
| `action_set_code`         | Updates the smart contract's code.                                                         |
| `action_reserve_currency` | Reserves a portion of the account's balance. This is especially useful for gas management. |
| `action_change_library`   | Changes the library used by the smart contract.                                            |

These actions are executed _in the order in which they were created_ during code execution.
A total of up to [255 actions](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/cac968f77dfa5a14e63db40190bda549f0eaf746/crypto/block/transaction.h#L164) can be made.

Here is the TL-B schema, which defines the structure of the action phase:

```tlb
tr_phase_action$_ success:Bool valid:Bool no_funds:Bool
  status_change:AccStatusChange
  total_fwd_fees:(Maybe Grams) total_action_fees:(Maybe Grams)
  result_code:int32 result_arg:(Maybe int32) tot_actions:uint16
  spec_actions:uint16 skipped_actions:uint16 msgs_created:uint16
  action_list_hash:bits256 tot_msg_size:StorageUsed
  = TrActionPhase;
```

## Bounce phase

If the **Compute phase** or **Action phase** ends with an error, and the incoming message has the `bounce` flag set, the system triggers the **Bounce phase**.

<Aside
  type="note"
  title="Bounce on error"
>
  For the bounce phase to trigger due to an error in the action phase, the failed action must have **flag 16** set, which enables bounce on error.
</Aside>

```tlb
tr_phase_bounce_negfunds$00 = TrBouncePhase;
tr_phase_bounce_nofunds$01 msg_size:StorageUsed
  req_fwd_fees:Grams = TrBouncePhase;
tr_phase_bounce_ok$1 msg_size:StorageUsed
  msg_fees:Grams fwd_fees:Grams = TrBouncePhase;
```

The `tr_phase_bounce_negfunds` type is not used in the current version of the blockchain. The other two types function as follows:

| Type                      | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tr_phase_bounce_nofunds` | Indicates that the account does not have enough funds to process the message that should be bounced back to the sender. |
| `tr_phase_bounce_ok`      | Indicates that the system successfully processes the bounce and sends the message back to the sender.                   |

In this phase, `msg_fees` and `fwd_fees` are calculated from the `total_fwd_fees`:\
approximately $\frac{1}{3}$ goes to `msg_fees` and $\frac{2}{3}$ go to `fwd_fees`.

> See [Fees → Forward fee](/foundations/fees#forward-fee) for more info.

### Key points

- If the receiver cannot parse the message and terminates with a non-zero exit code, the message bounces back automatically.
- The bounced message has its `bounce` flag cleared and `bounced` flag set, and contains `0xffffffff` (32-bit) op code followed by the original message body.
- Always check the `bounced` flag before parsing `op` to avoid treating a bounce as a new query.
