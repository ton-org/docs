title: "`StateInit` structure"
---

`StateInit` is a data structure sent as part of a message, either internal or incoming external, used to

- deploy a smart contract, for which it stores the initial code and data of a contract;
- [unfreeze](/foundations/status#status-transitions) a contract, where its _last_ code and data.

This structure can be appended in-place or as a referenced cell to every message:

```tlb
message$_
    {X:Type}
    info:CommonMsgInfo
    init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))
    body:(Either X ^X)
= Message X;
```

The `StateInit` structure is defined as follows:

```tlb
_
    fixed_prefix_length:(Maybe (## 5))
    special:(Maybe TickTock)
    code:(Maybe ^Cell)
    data:(Maybe ^Cell)
    library:(Maybe ^Cell)
= StateInit;
```

where the fields are:

- `special`: indicating was this message created by the [tick-tock transaction](/foundations/messages/tick-tock) or not.
- `code`: the initial code of the contract.
- `data`: the initial data of the contract.
- `library`: the initial library of the contract.
- `fixed_prefix_length`: the first `fixed_prefix_length` bits of the address are not compared against the state hash. This allows deploying an account to an arbitrary shard regardless of the hash of `StateInit`. At the moment, it can be at most 8. The limit is set in the config [param 43](/foundations/config#param-43%3A-account-and-message-limits).
