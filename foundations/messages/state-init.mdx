title: "StateInit Structure"
---

`StateInit` is a special structure used to initialize a smart contract or [unfreeze](/foundations/status#status-transitions) it. It contains the initial code and data of the contract to be deployed or its last code and data if the unfreeze is needed. For both aims it should be sent with some message.

This structure can be appended in-place or as a referenced cell to every message:

```tlb
message$_ {X:Type} info:CommonMsgInfo
    init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))
    body:(Either X ^X) = Message X;
```

The `StateInit` structure is defined as follows:

```tlb
_ fixed_prefix_length:(Maybe (## 5)) special:(Maybe TickTock)
    code:(Maybe ^Cell) data:(Maybe ^Cell)
    library:(Maybe ^Cell) = StateInit;
```

Where the fields are:
- `fixed_prefix_length`: when deploying an account with `fixed_prefix_length` in `StateInit` of the message, the first `fixed_prefix_length` bits of the address are not compared against the state hash. This allows deploying an account to an arbitrary shard regardless of the hash of `StateInit`.
- `special`: indicating was this message created by the [tick-tock transaction](/foundations/messages/tick-tock) or not. 
- `code`: the initial code of the contract.
- `data`: the initial data of the contract.
- `library`: the initial library of the contract.
