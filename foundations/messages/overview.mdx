## Messages

Messages are objects of the following structure:

```tlb
message$_
    {X:Type}
    info:CommonMsgInfo
    init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))
    body:(Either X ^X)
= Message X;
```

- `init` is an optional field of [`StateInit`](/foundations/messages/deploy) type used to initialize the contract state, stored either in-place or in a ref of the cell with a message.
- `body` is the actual message content that can be stored either in-place or in a reference. Typically, it is the payload of the message that will be read by the receiver.
- `info` describes the type of the message, and fields specific to messages of this type:
  - [Internal messages](/foundations/messages/internal) are messages from one contract to another.
  - [Incoming external](/foundations/messages/external-in) messages are messages from the outside world to the contract.
  - [Outbound external](/foundations/messages/external-out) messages are messages from the contract to the outside world. They can be interpreted as logs.

## Transactions

A transaction is a record that stores the state changes of a contract. A contract's state cannot be changed without a transaction. When a contract processes a message, a transaction may occur as the result of its processing.

- When an internal message is processed, a transaction is always created.
- When an incoming external message is processed, a transaction will be created only if the contract [accepts](/foundations/messages/external-in#accept-message) the message.
- When an outbound external message is processed, a transaction is never created, because outbound external messages can't change contract state.

However, a transaction may be created independently of message processing by

- [tick-tock transactions](/foundations/messages/exotic-tx)
- [split-prepare transactions](/foundations/messages/exotic-tx)
- [split-install transactions](/foundations/messages/exotic-tx)
- [storage-tx transactions](/foundations/messages/exotic-tx)
