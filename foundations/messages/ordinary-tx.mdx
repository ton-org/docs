title: "Ordinary transactions"
---

Ordinary [transactions](/foundations/messages/transaction-overview) are the most common type of transaction as they occur as the result of processing [incoming external](/foundations/messages/external-in) and [internal](/foundations/messages/internal) messages. More specifically, they may occur only as the result of processing such messages. The phases of transaction are described in detail in the [dedicated page](/foundations/phases).

Contents of the ordinary transaction are as follows:
```tl-b
trans_ord$0000
    credit_first:Bool
    storage_ph:(Maybe TrStoragePhase)
    credit_ph:(Maybe TrCreditPhase)
    compute_ph:TrComputePhase
    action:(Maybe ^TrActionPhase)
    aborted:Bool
    bounce:(Maybe TrBouncePhase)
    destroyed:Bool
  = TransactionDescr;
```

Ordinary transactions have specific fields:

- `credit_first` indicates whether the transaction started with a credit phase, or with a storage phase. This flag is equal to `bounce` flag of the message that triggered the transaction. Equal to `true` if the transaction was triggered by an incoming external message.
- `storage_ph` indicates the result of the storage phase: the number of storage fees collected and the possible state change of the contract. This field is never equal to `Nothing` in the current implementation.
- `credit_ph` indicates the result of the credit phase: the number of credits collected and the possible state change of the contract. This field is equal to `Nothing` if the transaction was triggered by an incoming external message.
- `compute_ph` holds the result of TVM execution on the contract. If this phase is skipped for some reason e.g., no funds, or no state on a destination account, then this field will contain the skip reason.
- `action_ph` holds the result of the action phase. This field will be equal to `Nothing` if compute phase failed, and will not be `Nothing` otherwise.
- `aborted` is the flag that represents, whether the action phase was successful or not.
- `bounce` holds the result of the bounce phase, equal to `Nothing` if there was no bounce phase.
- `destroyed` indicates, whether the account was deleted in the action phase by using [`SendDestroyIfZero`](/foundations/messages/modes). If the contract was deleted in the action phase, this flag is equal to `false`.
