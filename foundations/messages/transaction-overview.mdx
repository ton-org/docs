title: "Transactions overview"

A transaction is a record that stores every state change of a contract. A contract's state cannot be changed without a transaction. Each transaction has the following structure:

```tlb
    transaction$0111
    account_addr:bits256
    lt:uint64
    prev_trans_hash:bits256
    prev_trans_lt:uint64
    now:uint32
    outmsg_cnt:uint15
    orig_status:AccountStatus
    end_status:AccountStatus
    ^[
        in_msg:(Maybe ^(Message Any))
        out_msgs:(HashmapE 15 ^(Message Any))
    ]
    total_fees:CurrencyCollection
    state_update:^(HASH_UPDATE Account)
    description:^TransactionDescr
= Transaction;
```

Transactions implement the concept of `AccountChain` described in the [TON Blockchain whitepaper](/foundations/whitepapers/tblkch#1-2-1-the-infinite-sharding-paradigm-isp-applied-to-blockchain-block-and-state). Each account state can be interpreted as a separate blockchain, so transactions follow a strict order defined by the `prev_trans_hash` field. Thanks to the TON consensus protocol, a transaction becomes final when the first masterchain block references it by storing the hash of the corresponding `ShardChain` state, which in turn stores the hash of the `AccountChain` state.

Because transactions form the `AccountChain`, each one carries a logical timestamp, `lt`, that strictly increases with every new transaction of the account. The `now` field stores the Unix time when the transaction was created.

The `state_update` field is a [Merkle update](/foundations/serialization/merkle-update) that captures the difference between the previous and current state of the account. The [contract status](/foundations/status) before and after the transaction is duplicated for convenience.

Other fields, such as `in_msg`, `out_msgs`, and `outmsg_cnt`, relate to the [messages](/foundations/messages/overview) processed and emitted during the transaction. A trace may start from a transaction rather than a message, in which case `in_msg` is `Nothing`. However, a trace cannot continue without messages: if it contains `n` transactions it must contain at least `n-1` messages. Consequently, a trace can include at most one non-ordinary transaction, because messages can trigger only an [ordinary transaction](/foundations/messages/ordinary-tx).

The `total_fees` field stores the total number of [fees](/foundations/fees) paid by the transaction. These fees may eventually be paid in extra currencies, but that feature is not implemented yet.
