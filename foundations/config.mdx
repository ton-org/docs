</Aside>

This page provides a description of the configuration parameters used in the TON Blockchain.

TON features a complex configuration consisting of many technical parameters, some of which are utilized by the blockchain itself, while others serve the ecosystem. However, only a limited number of individuals fully understand the significance of these parameters. This article aims to offer users a straightforward explanation of each parameter and its purpose.

## Prerequisites

This material should be read alongside the parameter list.

You can view the parameter values in the [current configuration](https://tonviewer.com/config), and the method of writing them into [cells](/tvm/serialization/boc) is outlined in the [block.tlb](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb) file in [TL-B](/languages/TL-B/overview) format.

<Aside>
  Configuration values are TL-B typed cells serialized into [Bags of Cells (BoC)](/tvm/serialization/boc).
</Aside>

All parameters are in place, and you won't get lost. For your convenience, please use the right sidebar for quick navigation.

## Param 0: config address

This parameter is the address of a special smart contract that stores the blockchain's configuration. The configuration is stored in the contract to simplify its loading and modification during validator voting.

<Aside>
  In the configuration parameter, only the hash portion of the address is recorded, as the contract always resides in the [MasterChain](/foundations/overview#masterchain) (WorkChain -1). Therefore, the full address of the contract will be written as `-1:<value of the configuration parameter>`.
</Aside>

[Parameter #0 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#0)

## Param 1: elector address

This parameter is the address of the [elector smart contract](/foundations/system-contracts), responsible for appointing validators, distributing rewards, and voting on changes to blockchain parameters.

[Parameter #1 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#1)

## Param 2: TON minting address

This parameter represents the address of the system, on behalf of which new Toncoins are minted and sent as rewards for validating the blockchain.

<Aside>
  If parameter 2 is missing, parameter 0 is used instead (newly minted Toncoins come from the configuration smart contract).
</Aside>

[Parameter #2 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#2)

## Param 3: fee collector address

This parameter is the address of the transaction fee collector.

<Aside>
  If this parameter is missing (for the time being), transaction fees are directed to the elector smart contract (parameter 1).
</Aside>

[Parameter #3 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#3)

## Param 4: root DNS address

This parameter is the address of the root DNS contract of the TON network.

<Aside>
  For details, see [TON DNS & Domains](/services/dns) and the [original specification](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0081-dns-standard.md).

  This contract is not responsible for selling **.ton** domains.
</Aside>

[Parameter #4 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#4)

## Param 6: extra currency fee

This parameter is responsible for minting fees for new currencies.

[Parameter #6 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#6)

## Param 7: extra currency volume

This parameter stores the volume of each extra currency in circulation. The data is organized as a dictionary (also referred to as a **hashmap**). The structure uses the format `currency_id -> amount`, where the amount is represented as a `VarUInteger 32`, which is an integer ranging from `0` to `2^248-1`.

[Parameter #7 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#7)

## Param 8: network version

This parameter indicates the network version and additional capabilities supported by the validators.

<Aside>
  Validators are nodes in the TON Blockchain network that are responsible for creating new blocks and verifying transactions.
</Aside>

- `version`: This field specifies the version.

- `capabilities`: This field is a set of flags that are used to indicate the presence or absence of certain features or capabilities.

Thus, when updating the network, validators will vote to change parameter 8. This way, the TON Blockchain network can be updated without downtime.

[Parameter #8 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#8)

## Param 9: mandatory params

This parameter contains a list (binary tree) of mandatory parameters. It ensures that certain configuration parameters are always present and cannot be removed by a proposal to change the configuration until parameter 9 changes.

[Parameter #9 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#9)

## Param 10: critical params

This parameter represents a list (binary tree) of critical TON parameters whose change significantly affects the network, so more voting rounds are held.

[Parameter #10 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#10)

## Param 11: config params

This parameter indicates under what conditions proposals to change the TON configuration are accepted.

- `min_tot_rounds`: The minimum number of rounds before a proposal can be applied. Currently, this parameter is not used: only `max_tot_round` (when the proposal will be rejected) and `min_wins` (when the proposal will be accepted) matter.

- `max_tot_rounds`: The maximum number of rounds, upon reaching which the proposal will automatically be rejected

- `min_wins`: The required number of wins (3/4 of validators by the sum of the pledges must vote in favor)

- `max_losses`: The maximum number of losses, upon reaching which the proposal will automatically be rejected

- `min_store_sec` and `max_store_sec` determine the possible time interval during which the proposal will be stored

- `bit_price` and `cell_price` indicate the price of storing one bit or one cell of the proposal

[Parameter #11 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#11)

## Param 12: WorkChain config

This parameter represents the configuration of a WorkChain in the TON Blockchain. WorkChains are designed as independent blockchains that can operate in parallel, allowing TON to scale and process a large number of transactions and smart contracts.

### WorkChain configuration parameters

- `enabled_since`: A UNIX timestamp of the moment this WorkChain was enabled.

- `actual_min_split`: The minimum depth of the split (sharding) of this WorkChain, supported by validators.

- `min_split`: The minimum depth of the split of this WorkChain, set by the configuration.

- `max_split`: The maximum depth of the split of this WorkChain.

- `basic`: A boolean flag (1 for true, 0 for false) indicating whether this WorkChain is basic (handles TON coins, smart contracts based on the TON Virtual Machine).

- `active`: A boolean flag indicating whether this WorkChain is active at the moment.

- `accept_msgs`: A boolean flag indicating whether this WorkChain is accepting messages at the moment.

- `flags`: Additional flags for the WorkChain (reserved, currently always 0).

- `zerostate_root_hash` and `zerostate_file_hash`: Hashes of the first block of the WorkChain.

- `version`: Version of the WorkChain.

- `format`: The format of the WorkChain, which includes `vm_version` and `vm_mode` - the virtual machine used there.

[Parameter #12 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#12)

## Param 13: complaint cost

This parameter defines the cost of filing complaints about the incorrect operation of validators in the [elector smart contract](/foundations/system-contracts).

[Parameter #13 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#13)

## Param 14: block reward

This parameter indicates the reward for creating a block in the TON Blockchain. Values are in nanotons (also referred to as nanograms); therefore, the reward for block creation in the MasterChain is 1.7 Toncoins, while in the BaseChain, it is 1.0 Toncoins. In the event of a WorkChain split, the block reward is also divided: if there are two ShardChains within the WorkChain, then the reward for each shard block will be 0.5 Toncoins.

[Parameter #14 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#14)

## Param 15: elections timing

This parameter contains the duration of different stages of elections and validators' work in the TON Blockchain.

For each validation period, there is an `election_id` equal to the UNIX-format time at the start of the validation.

You can get the current `election_id` (if elections are ongoing) or the past one by invoking the elector smart contract's respective get-methods `active_election_id` and `past_election_ids`.

### Election and validation timing parameters

- `validators_elected_for`: The number of seconds the elected validators perform their role (one round).

- `elections_start_before`: The seconds before the end of the current round, when the election process for the next period will start.

- `elections_end_before`: The seconds before the end of the current round, the validators for the next round will be chosen.

- `stake_held_for`: The period for which a validator's stake is held (for handling complaints) after the round expires.

<Aside>
  Each value in the arguments is determined by the `uint32` data type.
</Aside>

### Examples

In the TON Blockchain, validation periods are typically divided into **even** and **odd** rounds that alternate. Voting for the next round occurs during the previous one, so a validator must allocate their funds into two separate pools to participate in both rounds.

#### Mainnet

Current values:

```python
constants = {
    'validators_elected_for': 65536,  # 18.2 hours
    'elections_start_before': 32768,  # 9.1 hours
    'elections_end_before': 8192,     # 2.2 hours
    'stake_held_for': 32768           # 9.1 hours
}
```

Scheme:

![Election timing scheme (Mainnet)](/resources/images/limits/config15-mainnet.png)

#### How to calculate periods?

Let `election_id = validation_start = 1600032768`. Then:

```python
election_start = election_id - constants['elections_start_before'] = 1600032768 - 32768 = 1600000000
election_end = delay_start = election_id - constants['elections_end_before'] = 1600032768 - 8192 = 1600024576
hold_start = validation_end = election_id + constants['validators_elected_for'] = 1600032768 + 65536 = 1600098304
hold_end = hold_start + constants['stake_held_for'] = 1600098304 + 32768 = 1600131072
```

Therefore, at this time, the length of one round of one parity is `1600131072 - 1600000000 = 131072 seconds = 36.40888... hours`

#### Testnet

Current values:

```python
constants = {
    'validators_elected_for': 7200,  # 2 hours
    'elections_start_before': 2400,  # 40 minutes
    'elections_end_before': 180,     # 3 minutes
    'stake_held_for': 900            # 15 minutes
}
```

Scheme:

![Election timing scheme (Testnet)](/resources/images/limits/config15-testnet.png)

#### How to calculate periods?

Let `election_id = validation_start = 160002400`. Then:

```python
election_start = election_id - constants['elections_start_before'] = 160002400 - 2400 = 160000000
election_end = delay_start = election_id - constants['elections_end_before'] = 160002400 - 180 = 160002220
hold_start = validation_end = election_id + constants['validators_elected_for'] = 160002400 + 7200 = 160009600
hold_end = hold_start + constants['stake_held_for'] = 160009600 + 900 = 160010500
```

Therefore, at this time, the length of one round of one parity is `160010500 - 160000000 = 10500 seconds = 175 minutes = 2.91666... hours`

[Parameter #15 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#15)

- `max_stake_factor`: This parameter is a multiplier indicating how many times the maximum effective stake (pledge) can exceed the minimum stake sent by any other validator.

<Aside>
  Each value in the arguments is determined by the `uint32` data type.
</Aside>

[Parameter #17 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#17)

## Param 18: storage prices

This parameter represents the configuration for determining the prices for data storage on the TON Blockchain. This serves as a measure to prevent spam and encourages network maintenance.

### Dictionary of storage fee parameters

- `utime_since`: This parameter provides the initial Unix timestamp from which the specified prices apply.

- `bit_price_ps` and `cell_price_ps`: These parameters represent the storage prices for one bit or one cell of information in the main WorkChains of the TON Blockchain for 65536 seconds.

- `mc_bit_price_ps` and `mc_cell_price_ps`: These parameters represent the storage prices per bit and per cell in the TON MasterChain for 65536 seconds.

<Aside>
  `utime_since` accepts values in the `uint32` data type.

  The rest accept values in the `uint64` data type.
</Aside>

[Parameter #18 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#18)

## Param 20 and 21: gas prices

These parameters define the cost of computations in the TON network. The complexity of any computation is estimated in gas units.

Note: Param 20 defines gas settings for the MasterChain; Param 21 defines gas settings for other WorkChains.

- `flat_gas_limit` and `flat_gas_price`: A certain starting amount of gas is provided at a price of `flat_gas_price` (to offset the costs of launching the TON Virtual Machine).

- `gas_price`: This parameter reflects the price of gas in the network, in nanotons per 65536 gas units.

- `gas_limit`: This parameter represents the maximum amount of gas that can be consumed per transaction.

- `special_gas_limit`: This parameter represents the limit on the amount of gas that can be consumed per transaction of a special (system) contract.

- `gas_credit`: This parameter represents a credit in gas units provided to transactions to process an external message.

- `freeze_due_limit` and `delete_due_limit`: Limits of accumulated storage fees (in nanotons) at which a contract is frozen and deleted, respectively.

<Aside>
  You can find more about `gas_credit` and other parameters in the section of external messages [here](/tvm/instructions#external-messages).
</Aside>

[Parameter #20 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#20) | [Parameter #21 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#21)

## Param 22 and 23: block limits

These parameters set limits on the block, upon reaching which the block is finalized and the callback of the remaining messages (if any) is carried over to the next block.

### Configuration parameters

- `bytes`: This section sets the limits on the block size in bytes.

- `underload`: Underload is a state when the shard realizes that there is no load and is inclined to merge if a neighboring shard is willing.

- `soft_limit`: Soft limit - when this limit is reached, internal messages stop being processed.

- `hard_limit`: Hard limit - this is the absolute maximum size.

- `gas`: This section sets the limits on the amount of gas that a block can consume. Gas, in the context of blockchain, is an indicator of computational work. The limits on underload, soft and hard limits work the same as for size in bytes.

- `lt_delta`: This section sets the limits on the difference in logical time between the first and last transaction. Logical time is a concept used in the TON Blockchain for ordering events. The limits on underload, soft and hard limits work the same as for size in bytes and gas.

<Aside>
  If a shard has insufficient load and there is an intention to merge with a neighboring shard, the `soft_limit` indicates a threshold. When this threshold is exceeded, internal messages will stop being processed, while external messages will still be handled. External messages will continue to be processed until the total reaches a limit that is equal to half the sum of the `soft_limit` and `hard_limit`, or `(soft_limit + hard_limit) / 2`.
</Aside>

[Parameter #22 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#22) | [Parameter #23 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#23)

## Param 24 and 25: message price

Parameter 24 represents the configuration for the cost of sending messages in the MasterChain of the TON Blockchain.

Parameter 25 represents the configuration for the cost of sending messages in all other cases.

### Configuration parameters defining the costs of forwarding

- `lump_price`: This parameter means the base price for forwarding a message, regardless of its size or complexity.

- `bit_price`: This parameter represents the cost per bit of message forwarding.

- `cell_price`: This parameter reflects the cost of forwarding a message per cell. A cell is the basic unit of data storage on the TON Blockchain.

- `ihr_price_factor`: This is a factor used to calculate the cost of immediate hypercube routing (IHR).

<Aside>
  IHR is a method of message delivery in the TON Blockchain network, where messages are sent directly to the recipient's ShardChain.
</Aside>

- `first_frac`: This parameter defines the fraction of the remaining amount that will be used for the first transition along the message route.

- `next_frac`: This parameter defines the fraction of the remaining amount that will be used for subsequent transitions along the message route.

</Aside>

[Parameter #43 on mainnet](https://tonviewer.com/config#43)

## Param 44: suspended addresses

This parameter defines the list of suspended addresses, which cannot be initialized until `suspended_until`. It only applies to yet uninitiated accounts. This is a measure for stabilizing the tokenomics (limiting early miners). If not set, there are no limitations. Each address is represented as an end node in this tree, and the tree-like structure allows efficient checking of whether an address is in the list.

<Aside>
  The stabilization of the tokenomics is further described in the [official report](https://t.me/tonblockchain/178) of the **@tonblockchain** Telegram channel.
</Aside>
