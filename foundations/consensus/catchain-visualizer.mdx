To understand this simulation, read [Catchain whitepaper](/foundations/whitepapers/catchain) first.

<CatchainVisualizer

## Interact with the simulation

- Click nodes to view status (locks/commits) and toggle behavior (good, crash, lagging).
- Click **Adjust simulation config** at the top to change consensus simulation parameters.
- Hover over the **Event types** at the bottom to read short description.
- Click moving messages to inspect sender/receiver, timings, and embedded actions; drop a message from the overlay with **Drop message** button.
- Click **Candidates** in the sidebar to see proposer, priority, and per-node approvals/votes/precommit/commits observed.
- Use the speed slider to slow down/accelerate the sim; use **Restart round** to begin a new round.

## Simulation notes

<Aside>
  This is a teaching simulation, not the exact C++ `validator-session` implementation of the whitepaper. It contains certain simplifications.
</Aside>

- Timing is approximate; actions are driven by the sim loop and simplified delays, not the precise `check_all/process_blocks` cadence.
- Catchain dependency handling is simplified: if a node sees a message but lacks one of its parents, it asks peers for that missing block (no vector-time sync).
- Quorums use equal weights (counts), not stake weights.
- Submits are auto-scheduled per priority window; retries and network sync differ from the real catchain/validator logic.
- Null candidate is assumed after its delay; VoteFor/slow-mode handling is simplified.
