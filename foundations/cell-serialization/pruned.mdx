Pruned branch cells are cells that represent deleted subtrees of the tree of cells.

May have any level between `1` and `3`, which is equal to the level of a root of the pruned subtree plus one.
Each of pruned branch cells get serialized as follows.

- The 1-byte tag that always equals `1`.
- The byte that contains the pruned branch level mask, `1 <= mask <= 7`. The number of hashes stored in the pruned branch cell
  is equal to the number of `1-bits` in the mask.
- Next, `h * 32` bytes store [representations hashes](/foundations/cell-serialization/cells) of roots of the pruned subtrees starting
  from the last one. For example, if the mask equals `3` (binary `011`), then the pruned tree cell contains representation hashes of the second
  and the first pruned subtrees in sequential order, but not the third one.
- Finally, `h * 2` bytes store the depths of the pruned subtrees starting from the last one.
