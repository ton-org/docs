<Aside>
  The official language of TON Blockchain is [Tolk](/language/tolk), and all other languages are deemed legacy. That said, you can still use them and contribute to the surrounding tooling or documentation.
</Aside>

**FunC** is an intermediate-level language used to program smart contracts on TON. It is a domain-specific, statically typed language with C-like syntax.
To give a taste of FunC syntax, here is a simple example of a method for sending money written in FunC:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The method receives as parameters the [`address`](/ton/addresses/addresses-general-info) to send the money to,
and the `amount` to send. The method does not return a value, indicated by [`()`](/language/func/types#tensor-types) to the left of the method name `send_money`.
The method uses the `impure` and `inline` [specifiers](/language/func/functions#specifiers), which are flags that tell the compiler to process
the method in specific ways.

The method first creates the [message](/ton/transaction) to send `msg` by using a [cell builder](), since the message is encoded as a [cell]().
A new cell builder is created with function [`begin_cell`](/language/func/stdlib#begin-cell). Then, some [message flags]() are set, indicated at the line
with the single-line [comment](/language/func/comments) `;; nobounce`. Then, function [`store_slice`](/language/func/stdlib#store-slice) stores the receiving address,
followed by function [`store_coins`](/language/func/stdlib#store-coins)
which stores the amount to send. The builder finalizes the cell with a call to the [`end_cell`](/language/func/stdlib#end-cell) function.

Finally, function [`send_raw_message`](/language/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) sends the message, where the parameter `64` describes a [sending mode]().

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into Fift assembler code, generating the corresponding bitcode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm/overview).

Developers and engineers can use its bitcode, which is structured as a [tree of cells](/ton/cells/boc) like all data in the TON Blockchain, to create smart contracts or run it on a local instance of the TVM.

### Compile with JS

Using the Blueprint framework is the most convenient and quickest way to begin developing and compiling smart contracts. Read more in the [Blueprint](/ecosystem/blueprint/overview) section.

The following command installs all JS dependencies and creates a template project in the current working directory:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### Compile with original binaries

FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07).

<Aside>
  The last version for the FunC compiler was v2025.07. The FunC compiler is no longer developed. New releases are focused on the [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) compiler.

## TON Blockchain course

The [TON Blockchain course](https://stepik.org/course/176754/) covers FunC and smart contract development in its 4th module.

  I cannot find where the "Introduction" page is in the new docs!!!!!!!

  The best place to start developing with FunC is the [Introduction](/guidebook/first-smart-contract) section.
