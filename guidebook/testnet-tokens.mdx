TON testnet tokens are free test coins that can be used for development and testing before going live.

There are two ways to get testnet tokens:

## Option 1: Get free tokens from the Testgiver TON Bot

The Testgiver TON Bot is a Telegram bot that gives you 2 free test Toncoin per hour. It’s the easiest way to fund your test wallet for development.

To request testnet tokens:

1. Download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) on your device and create an account.

2. In your browser, open [@testgiver\_ton\_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) and click **Open Telegram**.

2. Once the bot opens, you'll see the bot info. Click **START** to begin.

3. From here, you have two ways to request TON:

- You can directly click the **Get 2 TON in testnet** button.

Either option will take you to the next step.

4. You'll be asked to complete a captcha. Click on the captcha image to open it in full size, then carefully enter the characters you see.

5. Once the captcha is complete, enter your testnet wallet address.

  Double-check that you're pasting your testnet wallet address. Mainnet and testnet addresses are different. See [How to read and write TON addresses](/ton/addresses/writing-and-reading-addresses#how-to-read-and-write-ton-addresses).

6. Once you submit your address, you'll see a confirmation message that your request has been added to the queue.

**That's it!** The bot will process the request and send you 2 test Toncoin.

<Aside type="note">You can request test TON once every hour. If you need more tokens, just wait and request again.</Aside>

## Option 2: Request larger amounts (up to 5,000 TON)

This option is ideal for projects with extensive testing needs that require more capacity than the standard 2 TON per hour.

You can request up to 5,000 testnet TON by filling out the [token request form](https://builders.ton.org/profile/projects/new?applicationSlug=testnet-form).

The form will be reviewed by the TON Foundation and the tokens will be sent directly to your testnet wallet address.

## Verify your balance

After requesting tokens, refresh your wallet to see the updated balance or verify the transaction using the Tonviewer Testnet explorer. Here's how: 

1. Open [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/), paste your wallet address in the search bar and Click **Find**.

2. You'll see your wallet details including your current balance and transaction history showing the testnet TON you received from the bot. Your wallet state will also show **uninit**, which means your wallet has received funds but hasn't been deployed yet.

**All done!** You now have testnet TON in your wallet. You can use this to [deploy your wallet](/wallet-apps/overview) by sending your first transaction, which will move your [account state](/ton/statuses#status-variety) from **uninit** to **active**.
