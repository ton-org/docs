[Nominator pool contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool) allow multiple nominators to delegate their stake to a validator without running validator infrastructure themselves. Funds from nominators are combined with the validator's own stake and used for network validation. The pool contract handles rewards and penalties according to predefined rules.

## Key parameters

- Minimum nominator stake: 10,000 TON, recommended.
- Maximum nominators per pool: 40.
- Operational costs: approximately 5 TON per validation round, paid by the validator.
- Withdrawals: full withdrawal only; partial withdrawals are not supported.
- Governance: nominators can participate in network configuration voting.

## When to use

Nominator pools are suitable for:

- Staking below the validator minimum of 300,000 TON.
- Delegating stake to trusted validators without running infrastructure.
- Participating in network governance.
- Using a simple staking model without liquidity tokens or DeFi participation.

## How it works

1. Nominators deposit funds into a pool managed by a validator.
1. The validator stakes the combined funds, including the validator's own and nominators' stakes, for validation.
1. Rewards are distributed proportionally:
   - The validator receives a commission defined by `validator_reward_share`.
   - The remaining rewards are distributed to nominators based on their stake size.
1. If the validator is penalized:
   - The penalty is first deducted from the validator's balance.
   - If the validator balance is insufficient, losses are deducted proportionally from nominators.
1. The validator must maintain enough balance to cover the maximum possible penalties.

## How to stake

1. Choose a pool on [TON Nominators](https://tonvalidators.org/) and review its parameters, commission, and minimum stake.
1. Send a message to the nominator pool contract with:
   - The desired TON amount.
   - The text comment "d" for deposit.
1. The sent amount must be at least `min_nominator_stake + 1 TON`, while 1 TON is deducted as the deposit fee.
1. If the pool is not currently validating, the deposit is credited immediately; otherwise, it is added to pending deposits.

## How to withdraw

1. Send a message to the nominator pool contract with:
   - The text comment "w" for withdraw.
   - Approximately 1 TON for network fees.
1. If the pool has sufficient balance, the withdrawal is processed immediately.
1. If not, a withdrawal request is created and processed later.
1. Only full withdrawal is supported.

## How to vote

1. Find the proposal hash posted in [`@tonblockchain`](https://t.me/tonblockchain) or [`@tonstatus`](https://t.me/tonstatus).
1. Send a message with comment `"y<HASH>"` to vote for or `"n<HASH>"` to vote against.
   - Example: `"yD855FFBCF813E50E10BEAB902D1177529CE79785CAE913EB96A72AE8EFBCBF47"`.
1. Attach approximately 1 TON for network fees.

## Reward calculation

Reward data can be obtained using the [TON Center nominator pools API](https://toncenter.com/api/smc-index/):

- [getPoolBookings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-pool-bookings-method) — get all the bookings, including debits and credits, in a specified pool.
- [getNominatorBookings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-bookings-method) — get nominator bookings, including debits and credits, in a specified pool.
- [getNominatorEarnings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-earnings-method) — get nominator income in a specified pool, including stake amounts on each time point.
- [getNominator](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-method) — get the nominator's balances across all pools in which the nominator participates.
- [getPool](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-pool-method) — get pool data, including all nominators.

## Validator setup

- Use [MyTonCtrl nominator pools](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#nominator-pool-operations-nominator-pool-mode) for standard multi-nominator operation.
- Pools can technically be configured with a minimum stake of 100 TON; however, 10,000 TON is the tested and recommended value.
- Validators can deploy pools manually using the [nominator pool contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool) without MyTonCtrl.
