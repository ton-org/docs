## Nominator pools: Architecture and Flow

### Overview

Nominator pools allow multiple nominators to delegate their stake to a validator without running validator infrastructure themselves. Funds from nominators are combined with the validator’s own stake and used for network validation. Rewards and penalties are handled by the pool contract according to predefined rules.

### How It Works

- Nominators deposit funds into a pool managed by a validator
- The validator stakes the combined funds (validator's own + nominators') for validation.
- Rewards are distributed proportionally:
  - The validator receives a commission defined by `validator_reward_share`.
  - The remaining rewards go to nominators based on their stake size.
- If the validator is penalized:
  - The penalty is first deducted from validator's balance.
  - If the validator balance is insufficient, losses are deducted proportionally among nominators.
- The validator must maintain enough balance to cover maximum possible penalties.

### Key Parameters

- Minimum nominator stake: 10,000 TON (recommended)
- Maximum nominators per pool: 40
- Operational costs: \~5 TON per validation round (paid by the validator)
- Withdrawals: Full withdrawal only (partial withdrawals are not supported)
- Governance: Nominators can participate in network configuration voting

### When to use Nominator Pools

Nominator pools are suitable if you want to:

- Stake below than the validator minimum (300,000 TON)
- Delegate stake to a trusted validators without running infrastructure
- Participate in network governance
- Use simple staking model without liquidity tokens or DeFi participation

### How to stake

1. Choose a pool on [TON Nominators](https://tonvalidators.org/) and review its parameters, commission, and minimum stake
1. Send a message to the nominator pool contract with
   - The desired TON amount
   - Text comment `"d"` (deposit)
1. The sent amount must be at least `min_nominator_stake + 1 TON` (1 TON is deducted as deposit fee)
1. If the pool is not currently validating, the deposit is credited immediately, otherwise, it's added to pending deposits

### How to withdraw

1. Send a message to the nominator pool contract with:
   - Text comment `"w"` (withdraw)
   - \~1 TON for network fees
1. If the pool has sufficient balance, the withdrawal is processed immediately.
1. If not, a withdrawal request is created and processed later.
1. Only full withdrawal is supported.

### How to Vote

1. Find the proposal hash posted in [`@tonblockchain`](https://t.me/tonblockchain) or [`@tonstatus`](https://t.me/tonstatus)
1. Send a message with comment `"y<HASH>"` to vote for, or `"n<HASH>"` to vote against (e.g., `"yD855FFBCF813E50E10BEAB902D1177529CE79785CAE913EB96A72AE8EFBCBF47"`)
1. Attach \~1 TON for network fees.

\### Reward Calculation

Reward data can be obtained using the [TON Center Nominator Pools API](https://toncenter.com/api/smc-index/) :

- [getPoolBookings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-pool-bookings-method) — get all the bookings (debits and credits) in specified pool
- [getNominatorBookings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-bookings-method) — get nominator bookings (debits and credits) in specified pool
- [getNominatorEarnings](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-earnings-method) — get nominator income in specified pool with his stake on each timepoint
- [getNominator](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-method) — get nominator's balances in all pools where he participates
- [getPool](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-pool-method) — get pool data with all its nominators

### Validator Setup

- Use [MyTonCtrl nominator pools](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#nominator-pool-operations-nominator-pool-mode) for standard multi-nominator operation
- Pools can technically be configured with a minimum stake of 100 TON, but 10,000 TON is the tested and recommended value
- Validators can deploy pools manually using the [nominator pool contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool) without MyTonCtrl.
