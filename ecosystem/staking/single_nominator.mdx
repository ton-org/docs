**How it works**

1. The owner (cold wallet) securely holds staking funds offline.
1. The owner deposits funds into the Single Nominator pool contract.
1. Validator (hot wallet on node) instructs contract to participate in validation cycles.
1. Contract transfers the stake to the Elector for validation.
1. After the validation cycle completes, the validator instructs contract to recover the stake.
1. Owner can withdraw funds at any time (withdrawals are restricted to the only owner only)

**Security properties**

- The validator's hot wallet cannot withdraw or steal funds.
- If the validator is compromised, the owner can immediately update the validator address.
- The owner can send raw messages to recover the stake in emergency situations.
- In extreme cases, the owner can upgrade the contract code.

**Validator setup **

- See: [MyTonCtrl single nominator pools](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#single-nominator-pool-operations-single-nominator-mode)

**Nominator instructions**

- To deposit, send an **empty message** with TON to the Single Nominator pool contract.
- To withdraw, send a message with 1 TON and the text comment `"w"` (withdraw) to the contract.

**Reward and penalty tracking:**

- Separate APIs are typically unnecessary, as the validator and nominator are usually the same entity (the original design assumption).
- If validation and staking are managed by different parties, rewards, penalties and fees must be calculated explicitly.
  - Penalties should be attributed to the validator, as they result from operational or hardware issues.
- At present, TON Center does not provide a dedicated API for Single Nominator pools.
  - This is similar to the limitations described for the [nominator pools API](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-bookings-method).
