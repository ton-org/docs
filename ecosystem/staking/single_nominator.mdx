[Single nominator pool contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/single-nominator) are designed for validators with [sufficient self-stake](https://tonscan.org/validators) who want to validate independently, without involving other participants.

## How it works

1. The owner, a cold wallet, securely holds staking funds offline.
1. The owner deposits funds into the single nominator pool contract.
1. The validator, a hot wallet on the node, instructs the contract to participate in validation cycles.
1. The contract transfers the stake to the elector for validation.
1. After the validation cycle completes, the validator instructs the contract to recover the stake.
1. The owner can withdraw funds at any time; withdrawals are restricted to the owner only.

## Security properties

- The validator's hot wallet cannot withdraw or steal funds.
- If the validator is compromised, the owner can immediately update the validator address.
- The owner can send raw messages to recover the stake in emergencies.
- In extreme cases, the owner can upgrade the contract code.

## Validator setup

Follow the [MyTonCtrl single nominator pools guide](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#single-nominator-pool-operations-single-nominator-mode).

## Nominator instructions

- To deposit, send an empty message with TON to the single nominator pool contract.
- To withdraw, send a message with 1 TON and the text comment "w" (withdraw) to the contract.

## Reward and penalty tracking

- Separate APIs are typically unnecessary, as the validator and the nominator are usually the same entity. This is the original design assumption.
- If validation and staking are managed by different parties, rewards, penalties, and fees must be calculated explicitly.
  - Penalties should be attributed to the validator, as they result from operational or hardware issues.
- TON Center does not provide a dedicated API for single nominator pools.
  - This is similar to the limitations described for the [nominator pools API](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/smc-index/get-nominator-bookings-method).
