## TON Whales nominator pools

### Pool creation

- Whales contracts allow pool creating with a minimum stake as low as 1 TON (not recommended)

### How it works

- Nominators deposit funds into Whales pools managed by validators
- Rewards are distributed proportionally minus validator commission
- Validator covers operational costs and is responsible for validation quality
- Funds are secured by smart contracts, but validators control pool operations

### When to use

- Small to medium stakes (50+ TON)
- Staking without validator setup or technical knowledge
- Users seeking a simple staking experience

### How to stake

1. Use the [TON Whales staking website](https://tonwhales.com/staking) to find a suitable pool and stake
1. Alternatively, send a message with TON and text comment `"Stake"` (case-sensitive) to a Whales-type nominator pool contract
1. The transferred amount must be equal `stake_amount + deposit_fee` (refer to pool details for the current fee)

### How to withdraw

1. Send a message with text comment `"Withdraw"` (case-sensitive) and include the required `withdraw_fee`
1. Withdrawals follow a two-step process: request first, then finalize after the funds are finalized
1. In some cases, withdrawals may be processed immediate if the pool has sufficient available balance
