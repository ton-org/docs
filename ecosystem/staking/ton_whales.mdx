[TON Whales](https://tonwhales.com/staking) nominator pool contracts can create a pool with a minimum stake as low as 1 TON; however, this is not recommended.

## When to use

- Small to medium stakes (50+ TON);
- Staking without validator setup or technical knowledge;
- Users seeking a simple staking experience.

## How it works

- Nominators deposit funds into Whales pools managed by validators.
- Rewards are distributed proportionally, minus validator commission.
- The validator covers operational costs and is responsible for validation quality.
- Funds are secured by smart contracts, while validators control pool operations.

## How to stake

1. Use the [TON Whales staking website](https://tonwhales.com/staking) to find a suitable pool and stake.
1. Alternatively, send a message with TON and the case-sensitive text comment "Stake" to a [Whales-type nominator pool contract](https://github.com/tonwhales/ton-nominators).
1. The transferred amount must be equal to `stake_amount + deposit_fee`; refer to the pool details for the current fee.


## How to withdraw

1. Send a message with the case-sensitive text comment "Withdraw" and include the required `withdraw_fee`.
1. Withdrawals follow a two-step process: request first, then finalize after the funds are received.

In some cases, withdrawals may be processed immediately if the pool has sufficient available balance.
