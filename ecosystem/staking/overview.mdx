Staking in TON enables earning rewards by locking Toncoin to support network security and validation. TON supports several staking solutions, each designed for different use cases and operational models. This guide covers the available staking contracts and guidance on how to choose the right approach.

Staking helps secure the network through Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and enables Toncoin holders to earn rewards. Depending on technical ability, stake size and participation goals, users may choose between Classic staking, Single Nominator, Nominator Pools and Liquid staking. Some solutions are suitable only for technically experienced operators, while others are intended for businesses providing staking as a service. However, all solutions are hard to setup, and currently, there are only a limited number of support tools.

## Overview of staking solutions

The following smart contracts are commonly used in the TON ecosystem:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Intention</th>
      <th>Features</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Classic staking</td>
      <td>Operators running validator nodes</td>
      <td>Full control; high technical and operational requirements</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>[Liquid staking contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/liquid-staking-contract)</td>
      <td>Staking providers servicing retail users</td>
      <td>Liquidity and DeFi integration via wrapped staking tokens</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>[Single-nominator](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/single-nominator)</td>
      <td>Large holders staking only their own funds</td>
      <td>Secure, mature contract-based self-staking; simple ownership model</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>[Nominator pool](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool)</td>
      <td>Small group of nominators delegating to one validator</td>
      <td>Has significant limitations; generally not recommended</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

  Technical minimum stake required to participate in validation is 300,000 TON. However, validators compete for 400 slots in each validation round. As a result, in practice the actual minimum stake is typically higher: \~700,000 TON.

  Current validator stakes can be viewed on [tonscan.org/validators](https://tonscan.org/validators). Scroll to the bottom of the list to see the validator with the lowest stake included in the current round.

### Classic staking

Classic staking involves running a validator node directly using [MyTonCtrl](/ecosystem/node/setup-mytonctrl) tool. This method provides full control over validation without using intermediate contracts, but it requires technical expertise to set up and maintain validator.

#### Key characteristics

- Requires users to run and maintain their own validator node.
- Requires a large minimum stake (technical minimum is \~300,000 TON, actual threshold depends on network conditions).
- Offers direct participation in consensus and reward generation.
- Provides the highest level of autonomy and control over the staking process.

#### Recommended use

- Validators who want full control and have the infrastructure and technical expertise to run a node.
- Users comfortable with operational responsibility and network maintenance.

### Liquid staking

The [liquid staking contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/liquid-staking-contract) enables staking services to issue liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing underlying staking position. LSTs can be used in DeFi while the underlying TON earns rewards.

#### Key characteristics

- Users deposit TON and receive wrapped tokens (e.g. tsTON) that can be used in DeFi.
- Liquidity remains accessible even when underlying funds are staked.
- Flexible staker-validator connections without central pools
- Low minimum deposits for broader participation
- Some protocols allow governance influence
- Safety: Reduced slashing risks via diversification
- Diversification: Easy fund spreading across validators

#### Recommended use

- Staking providers serving retail users.
- Projects building liquid staking products or yield-bearing tokens.
- Operators who do not have significant personal funds but want to run a staking business.

**Staking Providers**
The list below contains third-party staking providers who use liquidity pool for staking:

| Protocol                                     | Min deposit | Liquidity   | Voting | Withdrawal                   | Decentralized validation |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [Tonstakers](https://tonstakers.com)         | 1 TON       | Yes (tsTON) | Yes    | Up to 18h (instant possible) | Yes                      |
| [Bemo](https://bemo.finance)                 | 1 TON       | Yes (bmTON) | No     | 36-72h cooldown              | No                       |
| [Hipo](https://hipo.fi)                      | Varies      | Yes (hTON)  | No     | Avg 30h (instant possible)   | No                       |
| [TON Whales](https://tonwhales.com/staking)  | 50 TON      | **No**      | No     | Up to 18h                    | No                       |
| [TON Nominators](https://tonvalidators.org/) | 10,000 TON  | **No**      | Yes    | Up to 18h                    | No                       |

Tonstakers also offers automated compounding and decentralized validation.

All validators participating in these third-party protocols use MyTonCtrl for validation. For validator setup instructions, see:

- [Tonstakers setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/liquid-staking)
- [Nominator pool setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#nominator-pool-operations-nominator-pool-mode)
- [Single nominator pool setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#single-nominator-pool-operations-single-nominator-mode)

### Single nominator

[Single nominator](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/single-nominator) contract is the standard solution designed for large holders who want to stake their own funds while delegating validator operations to a trusted operator.

  Track actual minimum stakes at [tonscan.org/validators](https://tonscan.org/validators). The current minimum is about \~700,000 TON.
</Aside>

**Key features:**

- Supports a single nominator only.
- Separates cold wallet (owner) from hot wallet (validator) to prevent theft if validator node is compromised
- Reduced complexity compared to multi-nominator pools, making it secure and easy to audit
- Owner can recover stakes even in extreme scenarios like Elector contract upgrades
- Any modification would require a professional audit, which is costly and time-consuming; therefore, the contract remains intentionally unchanged.

#### Recommended use

- Large holders with the own funds.
- Validator wishing to separate fund custody from node operation.

### Nominator pools

[Nominator pools](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool) are smart contracts that allow a small group of nominators to combine their funds and delegate to a validator for staking collectively. However, it has important limitations and safety concerns.

#### Limitations

- Only the owner can withdraw funds from the pool.
- Supports up to \~40 nominators, which is not suitable for large pools.
- Not designed for small deposits or retail participation.
- If a message without a bounce flag is sent to the pool than it may lock the funds.

#### Notes

- The contract is not deprecated, but in practice it is rarely appropriate today.
- For large holders, single-nominator is strongly preferred.
- Not recommended for new staking services.

### TON Whales nominator pools

[TON Whales](https://tonwhales.com/staking) is a nominator pool service built using custom smart contracts developed by the TON Whales team. It provides the same core functionality as standard nominator pools, with different contract architecture and significantly lower entry threshold.

### Differences from standard nominator pools

- Lower minimum stake: 50 TON (compared to 10,000 TON in standard pools)
- Custom contract architecture: Separate Owner, Controller, Proxy, and Pool contracts
- Fee model: Deposit and withdrawal fees vary by pool (check pool details before staking)

### Recommendations on staking solutions

**Large holders stacking only their own funds**

- Use a single nominator for direct self-staking, or
- Stake via a reputable third-party staking provider

**Operators intending to run staking services for others**

- Use liquid staking contracts, which appropriate when accepting deposits from retail users or when building DeFi-compatible staking token.

**Small holders**

- Use a third-party staking service rather than running contracts directly.

### Combining staking with DeFi

Staking can be combined with various DeFi strategies to maximize returns and unlock additional value from staked assets.

**Liquid staking strategies:**

- **Re-staking liquid tokens**: After staking TON and receiving liquid tokens (e.g., tsTON), stake these tokens again to earn additional yields. This creates a compounding effect where staking rewards are earned on both the original stake and the liquid token rewards.
- **DeFi integration**: Use liquid staking tokens in lending protocols, DEX liquidity pools, and other DeFi applications to earn multiple yield streams simultaneously.
- For detailed strategies and examples, see [Tonstakers Earn](https://tonstakers.com/) which covers leveraged staking, collateral staking, and DEX liquidity provision.

**Vesting contracts with staking:**

- **Locked token purchases**: When buying tokens with a lock period via vesting contracts, buyers receive locked tokens that can be staked to participate in validation and earn rewards while they remain locked.
- This approach allows token buyers to generate income from locked assets during the vesting period, making locked token purchases more attractive while providing additional revenue streams.
- Setup instructions: See [Vesting contracts staking options](/standard/vesting#staking-options) for detailed configuration steps.
