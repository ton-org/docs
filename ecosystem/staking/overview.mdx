[Staking in TON](https://ton.org/en/stake) enables earning rewards by locking Toncoin to support network security and validation. TON supports several staking solutions, each designed for different use cases and operational models.

Staking secures the network through [proof-of-stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake). Depending on technical ability, stake size, and participation goals, users may choose between classic staking, single nominator, nominator pools, or liquid staking. Some solutions are suitable only for technically experienced operators, while others are intended for businesses providing staking as a service. However, all solutions require non-trivial setup, and there are limited number of support tools.

## Overview of staking solutions

The following smart contracts are commonly used in the TON ecosystem:

|                                   Option                                    |                       Intention                        |                           Features                           |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
|                               Classic staking                               |           Operators running validator nodes.           |  Full control; high technical and operational requirements.  |
| [Liquid staking](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/liquid-staking-contract) |       Staking providers servicing retail users.        |  Liquidity and DeFi integration via wrapped staking tokens.  |
|   [Single nominator](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/single-nominator)    |      Large holders staking only their own funds.       | Secure, contract-based self-staking; simple ownership model. |
|     [Nominator pool](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/nominator-pool)      | Small group of nominators delegating to one validator. |   Has significant limitations; generally not recommended.    |

  The technical minimum stake required to participate in validation is 300,000 TON. However, validators compete for 400 slots in each validation round. As a result, the actual minimum stake is typically higher, approximately 700,000 TON.

  Validator stakes can be viewed on [tonscan.org/validators](https://tonscan.org/validators). Scroll to the bottom of the list to see the validator with the lowest stake included in the current round.

## Classic staking

Classic staking involves [running a validator node](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/validator) using the [MyTonCtrl](/ecosystem/node/setup-mytonctrl) tool. This method provides full control over validation without intermediate contracts, but requires technical expertise to set up and maintain a validator.

### Key characteristics

- Requires users to run and maintain a validator node.
- Requires a large minimum stake. The technical minimum is approximately 300,000 TON; the actual threshold depends on network conditions.
- Offers direct participation in consensus and reward generation.
- Provides the highest level of autonomy and control over the staking process.

### Recommended use

- Validators who want full control and have the infrastructure and technical expertise.
- Users comfortable with operational responsibility and network maintenance.

## Liquid staking

The [liquid staking contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/liquid-staking-contract) enables staking services to issue liquid staking tokens (LSTs) that represent the underlying staking position. LSTs can be used in DeFi while the underlying TON earns rewards.

### Key characteristics

- Users deposit TON and receive wrapped tokens, e.g. tsTON, that can be used in DeFi.
- Liquidity remains accessible even when underlying funds are staked.
- Flexible staker-validator connections without centralized pools.
- Low minimum deposits for broader participation.
- Some protocols allow governance influence.
- Reduced slashing risks using diversification.
- Easy fund spreading across validators.

### Recommended use

- Staking providers serving retail users.
- Projects building liquid staking products or yield-bearing tokens.
- Operators who want to run staking services without commiting significant personal funds.

### Staking providers

Third-party staking providers who use liquidity pool for staking:

|                   Protocol                   | Min deposit |  Liquidity  | Voting |          Withdrawal          | Decentralized validation |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|:----------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|     [Tonstakers](https://tonstakers.com)     |    1 TON    | Yes (tsTON) |  Yes   | Up to 18h (instant possible) |                      Yes |
|         [Bemo](https://bemo.finance)         |    1 TON    | Yes (bmTON) |   No   |       36-72h cooldown        |                       No |
|           [Hipo](https://hipo.fi)            |   Varies    | Yes (hTON)  |   No   |  Avg 30h (instant possible)  |                       No |
| [TON Whales](https://tonwhales.com/staking)  |   50 TON    |   **No**    |   No   |          Up to 18h           |                       No |
| [TON Nominators](https://tonvalidators.org/) | 10,000 TON  |   **No**    |  Yes   |          Up to 18h           |                       No |

Tonstakers offers automated compounding and decentralized validation.

All validators participating in these third-party protocols use MyTonCtrl for validation. For validator setup instructions, see:

- [Tonstakers setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/liquid-staking)
- [Nominator pool setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#nominator-pool-operations-nominator-pool-mode)
- [Single nominator pool setup](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/pools#single-nominator-pool-operations-single-nominator-mode)

## Single nominator pools

[Single nominator pool contract](/ecosystem/staking/single_nominator) is the standard solution designed for large holders who want to stake their own funds while delegating validator operations to a trusted operator.

  Track the actual minimum stakes at [tonscan.org/validators](https://tonscan.org/validators). The current minimum is about 700,000 TON.
</Aside>

### Key characteristics

- Supports a single nominator.
- Separates the owner's cold wallet from the validator's hot wallet to prevent theft if the validator node is compromised.
- Reduced complexity compared to multi-nominator pools, making it secure and easy to audit.
- The owner can recover stakes even in extreme scenarios, such as elector contract upgrades.
- Any modification would require a professional audit, which is costly and time-consuming; therefore, the contract remains intentionally unchanged.

### Recommended use

- Large holders with their own funds.
- Validators who want to separate fund custody from node operation.

## Nominator pools

[Nominator pools](/ecosystem/staking/nominator_pools) are smart contracts that allow a small group of nominators to combine their funds and delegate to a validator for staking collectively. However, it has limitations and safety concerns.

### Limitations

- Only the owner can withdraw funds from the pool.
- Supports up to approximately 40 nominators, which is not suitable for large pools.
- Not designed for small deposits or retail participation.
- Sending a message to the pool without a bounce flag may result in funds becoming locked.

### Notes

- The contract is not deprecated, but it is rarely an appropriate choice in practice.
- For large holders, the single nominator contract is preferred.
- This solution is not recommended for new staking services.

## TON Whales nominator pools

[TON Whales](/ecosystem/staking/ton_whales) is a nominator pool service built using custom smart contracts developed by the TON Whales team. It provides the same core functionality as standard nominator pools, with a different contract architecture and lower entry threshold.

## Differences from standard nominator pools

- Lower minimum stake of 50 TON, compared to 10,000 TON in standard pools.
- Custom contract architecture with separate owner, controller, proxy, and pool contracts.
- Fee model where deposit and withdrawal fees vary by pool; users should check pool details before staking.

## Recommendations for staking solutions

For large holders staking only their own funds:

- Use a single nominator contract for direct self-staking, or
- Stake through a reputable third-party staking provider.

For operators intending to run staking services for others:

- Use liquid staking contracts, which are appropriate when accepting deposits from retail users or when building DeFi-compatible staking tokens.

For small holders:

- Use a third-party staking service rather than running contracts directly.

## Combining staking with DeFi

Staking can be combined with various DeFi strategies to maximize returns and unlock additional value from staked assets.

### Liquid staking strategies

- Re-stake liquid tokens. After staking TON and receiving liquid tokens such as tsTON, these tokens can be staked again to earn additional staking rewards. This creates a compounding effect, as rewards are earned on both the original stake and the liquid tokens.
- DeFi integration. Use liquid staking tokens in lending protocols, DEX liquidity pools, and other DeFi applications.
- Practical examples of leveraged staking, collateral staking, and DEX liquidity provision are available in the [Tonstakers Earn](https://app.tonstakers.com/earn).

### Vesting contracts with staking

Tokens acquired through [vesting contracts](/standard/vesting) remain locked for a defined period but can be staked during vesting. This allows token holders to participate in validation and earn staking rewards while the tokens remain locked.

Configuration details are described in the [Vesting contracts staking options](/standard/vesting#staking-options).
