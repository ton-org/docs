# Overview
This page provides an overview of Tonviewer, the TON blockchain explorer.

## What is Tonviewer
Tonviewer is the TON blockchain explorer that lets you inspect blocks, transactions, contracts, and tokens.

## Key capabilities
- Search by address, transaction hash, message hash, or block:
> Examples:
> - `UQD5mxRgCuRNLxKxeOjG6r14iSroLF5FtomPnet-sgP5xI-e` or `Binance`
> - `421a98de86864a05dd024f5e0e7e584c9eb8ba11fa11c88c4a5658acd23a376c`
> - `/ql+i1av9h9v/VJV5VVDmIP5OOlcQoorhjjft9s+0Sg=`
> - `0,8000000000000000,57149294`
- Address: balance and assets (Jettons, NFTs), fiat portfolio value, activity history, contract code and data; ability to run get‑methods.
- Blocks and validators: detailed block card; links to adjacent and key blocks; transaction count; masterchain/prev‑refs; merge/split flags and key block indicator; used blockchain config; BoC download button.

## Quick start
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste an address/hash into the search bar.
3. Explore the tabs: Overview, History, Tokens, Collectibles, Code, Methods

## Typical scenarios
- [Check an address balance and recent activity](#check-an-address-balance-and-recent-activity)
- [Trace a transaction: inputs/outputs, fees, related messages, errors](#trace-a-transaction)
- [Inspect a contract: code, storage, method calls](#inspect-a-contract)
- [Check NFTs for an address](#check-nfts-for-an-address)

### Check balance and recent activity
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste an address into the search bar
3. Explore the header for the balance and the History tab to see recent activity.

### Trace a transaction
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste a transaction or message hash into the search bar.
3. Review the trace header: status (Confirmed/Failed), timestamp, and duration.
4. In Event Overview, see high‑level actions (e.g., Transfer TON/Jetton), the route (sender → recipient), decoded payload/comment and the value transferred. Hover a row to highlight the underlying transaction.
5. Click Show details or any transaction circle to inspect low‑level data.  
Key sections you will see:
  - Transaction summary.
  - [Fees](/ton/phases-and-fees#fee-calculator).
  - Compute phase: exit code (0 = success) and [gas used](/ton/phases-and-fees#computation-fee).
  - Action phase: result code, total actions, and skipped actions.
  - Internal message(s): Destination, Value, Forward Fee, Hash, Bounced and Bounce flags, Init (if present).
  - Utilities: Copy raw transaction and links to alternative explorers (ton.cx, toncoin.org) and tools (retracer).
  - For developers, it can be very useful to inspect the transaction in [TxTracer](https://txtracer.ton.org/).
6. For failing transactions, check Exit code/Result code and Compute details to identify the reason (e.g., invalid op, not enough balance, access control) and which hop produced the error. Inspect Internal message flags (Bounced/Bounce) for bounce behavior. For error meanings, refer to [TVM exit codes](/tvm/exit-codes) and the contract code.

### Inspect a contract
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste a contract address into search bar
3. Review the contract header: type (e.g., wallet_v4r2 or a custom contract), status (e.g., active/uninit/nonexist/frozen).
4. Open the Code tab to inspect the contract code if it has been verified; otherwise, you will see the raw cell.
5. Open the Methods tab to run get methods. The explorer indexes only methods that can be called without parameters (e.g., seqno, get_public_key), but you can run any method by typing it into the input field and clicking Execute.

### Check NFTs for an address
1. Open Tonviewer: [tonviewer.com](https://tonviewer.com)
2. Paste an address into the search bar.
3. Open the Collectibles tab to see the NFTs owned by the address.
4. Click an NFT to open its page.
