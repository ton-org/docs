Tonviewer is a TON Blockchain explorer that allows you to inspect blocks, transactions, contracts, and tokens, as well as analyze activity.

## High-level entities

High-level entities provide the foundation for exploring TON Blockchain, understanding and tracking operations.
They are essential for identifying transactions and tracing data flow across the network.

- [Accounts](/foundations/statuses) — the primary entities representing actors on the blockchain.
- [Addresses](/foundations/addresses/overview) — unique identifiers for accounts, showing balances and activity in Tonviewer.
- [Messages](/foundations/transaction) — instructions sent between addresses. In explorers, they reveal what actions are initiated and how they lead to transactions.
- [Transactions](/foundations/transaction) — records of executed messages. Explorers display their details linked to a specific address.
- [Blocks](/foundations/whitepapers/tblkch) — containers of transactions. In explorers, they expose block metadata and configuration parameters, allowing you to trace activity and understand how the blockchain operates.

## Reading traces

### Traces

In Tonviewer, operations are visualized through traces.
A trace is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:

- transactions are nodes on an account's address
- messages are edges between addresses

### Using the UI

Tonviewer provides a visual interface for exploring traces:

- Hover over a **node** to see details about the account where a transaction succeeded or failed.
- Hover over an **edge** to inspect the message contents.
- Use **Show details** to examine full transaction and message information.

<Aside>
  The UI may change, but the approach to reading traces remains consistent.

### Steps to read a trace

1. **Determine the operation**

The external-in message initiates the trace and defines the operation, such as a transfer, swap, or staking action.

2. **Clarify accounts' roles**

Examine the accounts involved — wallet addresses, jetton wallets, jetton master wallets, and DEX contracts. It clarifies the role of each account in the operation flow.

3. **Read messages**

Examine each message (edge in the trace). Its payload defines the intended actions and the transferred value:

- value — amount of TON or jettons transferred
- opcode — instruction type
- payload — instructions

4. **Check transaction phases**

Each transaction executes in phases. In the compute and action phases, an exit code of 0 indicates success; a non-zero code signals an error. This identifies which action succeeded and which failed.

5. **Find the failure point**

Some failures can occur even if all transactions are successful. Examine messages and payloads to identify where an operation was constrained or prevented from proceeding.

## Failed use cases

The following examples illustrate traces where operations did not complete as intended, even when transactions appear successful. They demonstrate a general approach to reading traces and identifying the point of failure.

### Jetton transfer

Analyze a [jetton transfer](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/d5d50c3e5bde493ddc7853f784bdff75a37bf89473e77ba8d04615323c7c8117) attempt.

![Jetton transfer](/resources/images/tonviewer/jetton_transfer.png)

1. **Determine the operation**

At point **A** (mintmachine.ton), an external-in message initiates the operation, instructing _a jetton transfer_.

2. **Clarify accounts' roles**

- A — sender’s wallet contract (mintmachine.ton), initiates the transfer.
- B — jetton wallet contract governed by the jetton master, holds the tokens and executes the transfer.

3. **Read messages**

- A → B: jetton transfer message with 0.2 TON attached to cover execution fees.

4. **Check transaction phases**

The transaction at **B** failed during execution, with a non-zero exit code.

5. **Find the failure point**

Exit code `48` per [jetton contract logic](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/jetton-contract/blob/main/contracts/op-codes.fc#L33) indicates that there isn't enough gas to complete the transfer.
The attached TON was insufficient to cover execution and forwarding, so the contract aborted the transfer.

### NFT transfer

Analyze an [NFT transfer](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/d8b5dbfe1c115178f47b486d03982159ec8abe684cdbe1c75587293e877564d4) attempt.

![NFT transfer](/resources/images/tonviewer/nft_transfer.png)

1. **Determine the operation**

At point **A** (address `UQDj…D0lN`), the user’s wallet sends an external-in message to _transfer an NFT_.

2. **Clarify accounts' roles**

- A — the user's wallet, initiates the transfer.
- B — the NFT contract at address `EQCo…gJdV`, validates ownership and executes the transfer.

3. **Read messages**

- A → B: NFT transfer message with 0.04 TON attached.
- B → A: bounce returning 0.036514 TON.

4. **Check transaction phases**

The transaction at **B** failed in the compute phase, with an exit code of `401`.

5. **Find the failure point**

According to the [NFT standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/nft/nft-item.fc#L65), exit code `401`  means that the sender is not the owner of the NFT.
Because the ownership check failed, the contract rejected the transfer and returned the unused funds to **A**.

### DEX swap

Analyze a [token swap](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/fa8e119f8911d20bb078b9b81a3fc1f8ff2bcc723eda3ac7e873e97f455812e7) attempt from **DYX** to **pTON**.

![DEX swap](/resources/images/tonviewer/dex_swap.png)

1. **Determine the operation**

The trace begins at point **A** (the user’s `mintmachine.ton` contract). An external-in message initiates the _token swap attempt_.

2. **Clarify accounts' roles**

- A — user's mintmachine.ton account, sending the initial funds.
- B — user's jetton wallet, holds the tokens.
- C — DEX jetton wallet, forwards tokens to the DEX.
- D — DEX smart contract executing the swap.
- E — jetton master (minter), authorizes token operations.

3. **Read messages**

- A → B: 0.3 TON transferred via a jetton transfer.
- B → C: jetton internal transfer to the DEX wallet.
- C → D: swap request sent to the DEX contract.
- C → A: return of excess funds.
- D → E: request to the jetton master.
- E → D: reply with `exit_code: 962605456 (0x39603190)`.

4. **Check transaction phases**

Transactions in A, B, C, D, and E all completed with exit code 0. No phase errors were reported.

5. **Find the failure point**

The issue appears in the payload of **E → D**. According to [Ston.fi docs](https://docs.ston.fi/developer-section/dex/smart-contracts/v2/op-codes#transfer-exit-codes), the `exit_code: 962605456` corresponds to _Swap out token amount is less than provided minimum value_.

This explains why, despite all transactions succeeding, the swap reverted: the output did not satisfy the minimum slippage tolerance.

## Successful use case

Analyze a [token swap](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b1dce2881224590a7c60e61594c68bd477f84fe81519b373da8fbed9c0269565) from **REDO** to **TON**.

![DEX swap successful case](/resources/images/tonviewer/dex_swap_1.png)

1. **Determine the operation**

An **external-in** message arrives at point **A** (mintmachine.ton), initiating the _token swap_.

2. **Clarify accounts' roles**

- A — mintmachine.ton account, provides initial funds for the swap.
- B — user's jetton wallet, holds the tokens.
- C — DEX jetton wallet, forwards tokens to the DEX.
- D — DEX smart contract executing the swap.
- E — jetton master (minter), authorizes token operations.
- F — DEX payout account (mergesort.t.me), receives the swapped tokens.

3. **Read messages**

- A → B: 0.2 TON transferred via a jetton transfer.
- B → C: internal jetton transfer to the DEX wallet.
- C → D: valid amount forwarded to the DEX contract for swap execution.
- C → A: return of excess funds.
- D → E: request to the jetton master (minter) to mint/settle token movements.
- E → external-out: issues an **external-out message** — confirmation that the operation succeeded.
- E → F: sends an internal message to the payout pool account.
- F → A: forwards the swap result to the initiator (`mintmachine.ton`).

4. **Check transaction phases**

All transactions along the trace completed their phases without error, no warning markers; exit codes are `0`. There are no bounces, failed compute or action phases reported in the nodes.

5. **Find the failure point**

No failure point — the operation completed successfully.
