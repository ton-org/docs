[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network) support exists for large custodial and institutional integrators, such as [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com), that require WalletConnect compatibility for interacting with DeFi applications on TON.

<Aside type="note">
  Applications that do not already require WalletConnect should not adopt it. This support exists exclusively for large custodial and institutional integrators.

  Most applications and wallets should continue to rely on [TON Connect](/ecosystem/ton-connect/overview) and [WalletKit](/ecosystem/ton-connect/walletkit/overview).
</Aside>

## Limitations

Due to Telegram policies, WalletConnect is not supported in applications within, such as [Telegram Mini Apps](/ecosystem/tma/overview).

If required, use [TON Connect](/ecosystem/ton-connect/overview) instead.

## How to integrate

1. Enable it explicitly in the application using `initializeWalletConnect()`.
1. Get a WalletConnect project ID at [`dashboard.reown.com`](https://dashboard.reown.com).

Example:

```typescript
import { initializeWalletConnect } from '@tonconnect/sdk';
import { UniversalConnector } from '@reown/appkit-universal-connector';

initializeWalletConnect(UniversalConnector, {
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    metadata: {
        name: 'My DApp',
        description: 'Example DApp',
        url: 'https://mydapp.com',
        icons: ['https://mydapp.com/icon.png']
    }
});
```
