**TON Connect WalletKit** is an open-source SDK that helps integrate your custodial or non-custodial wallet with TON in a secure and streamlined fashion.

It's designed for institutions, non-custodians, and custodians that need full control over key management, signing, and access without compromising UX or compliance.

## Features

- TON Connect protocol: Handles connect, disconnect, transaction and data sign requests
- Wallet management: Support for multiple TON wallets at once, with persistent storage and optional use of custom signers
- Action previews: Transaction emulation with money flow analysis
- Asset support: Toncoin (TON), Jettons (including USDTs), NFTs with metadata
- Platform availability: Use on the Web, on mobile (Android and iOS), and in browser extensions

## Use cases

WalletKit supports both small wallet services and large cross-chain systems.
