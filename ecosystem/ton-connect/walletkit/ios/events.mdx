  Initialize the WalletKit before adding events handler. See the [initialization guide](./init) for details.

## Connection

Before you are able to receive and handle wallet events, you need to set up an events handler and establish a connection with a dApp.

### Setting up events handler

You need to create your own implementation of an events handler and add it to the WalletKit instance:

```swift
import TONWalletKit

class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        // You can handle the event or throw an error
    }
}

let eventsHandler = YourCustomWalletEventsHandler()
try await walletKit.add(eventsHandler: eventsHandler)

// Additionally you can explicitly remove event handler
try await walletKit.remove(eventsHandler: eventsHandler)

// Once TONWalletKit instance is deinited handlers will not receive events anymore
```

### Establishing connection with dApp

To establish a connection with dApp you need to get a URL for connection request from any source (copy/paste, QRCode, deep link and etc.).

Once you have a connection URL you need to send it to Wallet Kit to perform connection request.

```swift
try await walletKit.connect(url: /* connection url */)
```

Once the connection request is performed, a connection event will be sent to your events handler.

The connection event contains an object that you can use to display request information to the user of your app and to approve (or reject) the request to finish connection establishment.

```swift
class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        switch event {
        case .connectRequest(let request):
            // Send request object to appropriate screen to display request information to app user
        default: ()
        }
    }
}

// Call appropriate method for corresponding app user action performed on some screen

// To approve
try await request.approve(walletAddress: /* TON wallet address */)

// To reject
try await request.reject(reason: /* rejection reason */)
```

After approval, connection will be established and you will be able to receive and handle other events associated with corresponding wallet.

## Handling events

All events handling is made through custom events handler.

Received events have a corresponding object you can use to show information to the user and to approve or reject the request depending on user action.

The only exception is a disconnection request. Even though it contains information you can show to a user, there is no need to approve or reject it.

### Transaction event handling

```swift
class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        switch event {
        case .transactionRequest(let request):
            // Send request object to appropriate screen to display request information to app user
        default: ()
        }
    }
}

// Call appropriate method for corresponding app user action performed on some screen

// To approve
try await request.approve()

// To reject
try await request.reject(reason: /* rejection reason */)
```

### Sign data event handling

```swift
class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        switch event {
        case .signDataRequest(let request):
            // Send request object to appropriate screen to display request information to app user
        default: ()
        }
    }
}

// Call appropriate method for corresponding app user action performed on some screen

// To approve
try await request.approve()

// To reject
try await request.reject(reason: /* rejection reason */)
```

### Disconnection event handling

```swift
class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        switch event {
        case .disconnect(let info):
            // Send info object to appropriate screen to display request information to app user
        default: ()
        }
    }
}
```
