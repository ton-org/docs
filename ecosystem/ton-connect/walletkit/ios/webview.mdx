  Initialize the WalletKit before injecting it into WebView See the [initialization guide](./init) for details.
</Aside>

You are able to to inject WalletKit into WebView. This will give you an ability to integrate your wallet app with dApp opened in native web view and handle events coming from that dApp.

Before you will be able to inject WalletKit into WebView you need to know dApp bridge key for injection.

```swift
import TONWalletKit
import WebKit

let walletKit = try await TONWalletKit.initialize(...)

let webView = WKWebView()
try? webView.inject(walletKit: walletKit, key: <dApp  bridge key>)
```

After injection is made you will be able to handle dApp events from your custom events handler

```swift
import TONWalletKit

class YourCustomWalletEventsHandler: TONBridgeEventsHandler {

    func handle(event: TONWalletKitEvent) throws {
        // You are able to handle event or throw an error
    }
}

let eventsHandler = YourCustomWalletEventsHandler()
try await kit.add(eventsHandler: eventsHandler)
```
