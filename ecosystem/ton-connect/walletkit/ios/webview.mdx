Injecting WalletKit into WebView allows integrating the wallet service with a dApp running in a native WebView and handling its events.

To do so, obtain the dApp injection bridge key — it is the name under which the dApp injects itself in the `window` object.

```swift
import TONWalletKit
import WebKit

let webView = WKWebView()
try webView.inject(walletKit: walletKit, key: /* dApp bridge key */)
webView.load(URLRequest(url: /* dApp URL */))
```

After the injection is complete, handle dApp events from a [custom events handler](/ecosystem/ton-connect/walletkit/android/events).
