You are able to inject WalletKit into WebView. This will give you an ability to integrate your wallet app with dApp opened in native WebView and handle events coming from that dApp.

Before you will be able to inject WalletKit into WebView you need to know dApp bridge key for injection.

<Aside type="tip">
  Initialize the WalletKit before injecting it into WebView See the [initialization guide](./init) for details.
</Aside>

```swift
import TONWalletKit
import WebKit

let webView = WKWebView()
try webView.inject(walletKit: walletKit, key: /* dApp  bridge key */)
```

After injection is made you will be able to handle dApp events from your custom events handler

You can check how to add custom events handler and handle wallets events [here](./events)
