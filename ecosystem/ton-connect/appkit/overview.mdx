TON Connect's **AppKit** is an open-source SDK that integrates web2 and web3 applications with TON. It enables wallet connection, authorization, asset transfers, balance tracking, and data signing.

## Features

- TON Connect protocol compliance: integrates with TON Connect, the standard wallet infrastructure for TON.
- Wallet management: access connected TON wallets from registered providers.
- Asset support: work with Toncoin (TON), jettons (tokens, i.e., USDT), and NFTs.
- React components: use ready-made UI elements for common cases

## Use cases

- Web2 apps that need to use TON for authorization, payments, NFT rewards, or other common needs.
- Web3 apps that need to integrate TON wallets.
- Telegram Mini Apps that utilize TON Blockchain to provide services for Telegram users.
