import {Aside} from "/snippets/aside.jsx";

To ensure stability and fair access, TON Center applies rate limits to all API requests.  
If your application exceeds these limits, the API returns a **429** response.

You can increase your limits by [requesting an API key](./get-api-key) and selecting a higher subscription plan.

## Default limits

| Plan | Tokens per Network | Requests per Second | Notes |
|------|--------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Free** | 1 | 10 | Shared liteservers — ideal for quick tests and small projects. |
| **Plus** | 3 | 25 | Private liteservers for more consistent performance. |
| **Advanced** | 10 | 100 | Private infrastructure with priority routing. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Tailored throughput and support. Contact [@toncenter_support](https://t.me/toncenter_support) for details. |

Rate limits apply per API token and per network (mainnet/testnet).

<Aside>
  Each token represents an individual API key used to authenticate requests.  
  Plans differ by how many tokens you can generate per network (mainnet and testnet).  
  For example, the "Free" plan allows 1 key per network, while higher plans provide multiple keys for separate apps or environments.

## Rate limit exceeded

When requests are sent faster than the allowed rate limit, the TON Center API temporarily blocks new ones.  
You’ll receive a JSON response that tells you the rate limit was exceeded:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "result": "Ratelimit exceed",
  "code": 429
}
```

When this occurs:

* Stop sending new requests and wait a few seconds before retrying.
* Implement exponential backoff to avoid repeated rate-limit violations.
