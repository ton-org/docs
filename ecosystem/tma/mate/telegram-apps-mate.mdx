Mate is a multifunctional tool for developers at the Telegram Mini Apps platform, that solves a wide range of problems.

## Installing

To start using Mate, it is required to install the `@telegram-apps/mate` package. The developer can do it both locally and globally:

```sh locally icon="npm"
npm i -D @telegram-apps/mate
```

```sh globally icon="npm"
npm i -g @telegram-apps/mate
```

Once installed, the package will be accessible via the `mate` CLI tool:

```bash
mate --help
```

It is highly recommended to install the package locally to avoid confusion over package versions and to ensure a consistent usage experience within the development team.

## Install-free Usage

Not to install the package, you can also use the package using `pnpm` or `npx`:

```sh icon="npm"
npx @telegram-apps/mate@latest --help
```
