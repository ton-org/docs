## How can I check the integration status of the SDK?

### Using a bot

After completing the integration process using the steps described with installation-via-less-than-script-greater-than-tag (TODO link), the bot will display the time of the last recorded event in our database. If it shows something like "one minute ago," this means that everything is working correctly.

### Using DevTools

#### Desktop version

Go to Telegram settings, then to Advanced Settings, and then to Experimental Settings. Toggle on the "**Enable webview inspecting" function.

Next, open your application and right-click to open the developer console. In the Network section, you should see the SDK script (index.js) loading and sending events. If this is not observed, try refreshing the application without closing TMA.

#### Web version

Go to [Telegram's web version](https://web.telegram.org/), open the developer tools, go to the network section, open your TMA, and filter queries by `'tganalytics.xyz'`. You'll see the SDK being loaded (index.js) and events being sent afterward.
