## Resources

- **Example Mini App:** Typescript version — [dapp](https://github.com/Dimitreee/demo-dapp-with-analytics).
- **Docs:** Access latest docs at [gitbook](https://docs.tganalytics.xyz/).

## Installation

Generate an access token through the [TON Builders](https://builders.ton.org). For detailed instructions on how to connect SDK and receive a token, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.tganalytics.xyz/).
After token generation, you need to initialize the SDK.

There are two ways to initialize analytics: using CDN and the script tag, or using the NPM package.

### Using a CDN

To add the Telegram Analytics SDK via CDN, include the following script`s in your HTML head:

```html
<script
    async
    src="https://tganalytics.xyz/index.js"
    onload="initAnalytics()"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

```html
<script>
    function initAnalytics() {
      window.telegramAnalytics.init({
        token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', // SDK Auth token received via @DataChief_bot
        appName: 'ANALYTICS_IDENTIFIER', // The analytics identifier you entered in @DataChief_bot
      });
    }
</script>
```

- [Example](https://github.com/sorawalker/demo-dapp-with-analytics/blob/patch-1/index.html)

### Using the NPM

Install using the npm:

```sh icon="npm"
npm install @telegram-apps/analytics
```

To ensure that all events are collected correctly, you must initialize the SDK before the application starts rendering. For example, in react applications, before calling the render() function

```javascript
import telegramAnalytics from '@telegram-apps/analytics';

telegramAnalytics.init({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', // SDK Auth token received via @DataChief_bot
    appName: 'ANALYTICS_IDENTIFIER', // The analytics identifier you entered in @DataChief_bot
});
```

After initializing the Telegram Analytics, you are all set to transfer the data, gain insights, and improve user engagement. Most of them will be tracked automatically without manual control.
