## Overview

Telegram Analytics is a powerful SDK and API that enables your mini-application to become a rich source of actionable data. By tracking user activity within your app, it transforms that data into clear, useful analytics that can help you optimize your application and enhance user engagement.

This library does not collect or store any private user data. It tracks app launches, TON Connect interactions, and GDPR-compliant events in an anonymous format. This data is used solely to rank applications in the catalog based on their performance and Streaks.

## Environment support

- Modern browsers
- Server-side Rendering
- [All known](https://telegram.org/apps) Telegram clients

## Resources

- **Example Mini App:** Typescript version â€” [dapp](https://github.com/Dimitreee/demo-dapp-with-analytics).
- **Docs:** Access latest docs at [gitbook](https://docs.tganalytics.xyz/).

## Installation

Generate an access token through the [TON Builders](https://builders.ton.org). For detailed instructions on how to connect the SDK and receive a token, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.tganalytics.xyz/).
After token generation, you need to initialize the SDK.

There are two ways to initialize analytics: using CDN and the script tag, or using the NPM package.

### Using a CDN

To add the Telegram Analytics SDK via CDN, include the following scripts in your HTML head:

```html
<script
    async
    src="https://tganalytics.xyz/index.js"
    onload="initAnalytics()"
    type="text/javascript"
></script>
```

```html
<script>
    function initAnalytics() {
      window.telegramAnalytics.init({
        token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', // SDK Auth token received via @DataChief_bot
        appName: 'ANALYTICS_IDENTIFIER', // The analytics identifier you entered in @DataChief_bot
      });
    }
</script>
```

- [Example](https://github.com/sorawalker/demo-dapp-with-analytics/blob/patch-1/index.html)

### Using the NPM

Install using the npm:

```sh icon="npm"
npm install @telegram-apps/analytics
```

To ensure that all events are collected correctly, you must initialize the SDK before the application starts rendering. For example, in React applications, before calling the render() function

```javascript
import telegramAnalytics from '@telegram-apps/analytics';

telegramAnalytics.init({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN', // SDK Auth token received via @DataChief_bot
    appName: 'ANALYTICS_IDENTIFIER', // The analytics identifier you entered in @DataChief_bot
});
```

After initializing the Telegram Analytics, you are all set to transfer the data, gain insights, and improve user engagement. Most of them will be tracked automatically without manual control.
