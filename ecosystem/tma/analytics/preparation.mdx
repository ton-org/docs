### Connect the TON Connect SDK

Web3 events for the Telegram Mini Apps Analytics SDK are supported by the [`@tonconnect/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui) and [`@tonconnect/ui-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui-react) libraries since version 2.0.3, [`@tonconnect/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/sdk) since version 3.0.3.

Don't worry if your app doesn't use TON Connect; the analytics SDK will still work and collect non-Web3 events.

### Get the token with TON Builders

Register your project on [TON Builders](https://builders.ton.org) and go to the Analytics tab.
