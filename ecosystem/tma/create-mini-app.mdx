`@telegram-apps/create-mini-app` is a CLI tool designed to scaffold your new
mini application on the Telegram Mini Apps platform. It generates a project with pre-configured libraries and template files,

## Creating a new application

your application by sequentially prompting for the following information:

### Project directory name

  The script will create a subfolder with the specified name in the current directory.
