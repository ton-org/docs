All TON Center API v3 methods use a standard set of HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request.

| Status code                 | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `401 Unauthorized`          | A required parameter was not included in the request.                              |
| `404 Not Found`             | The requested resource does not exist in storage.                                  |
| `409 Conflict`              | The resource was found but does not match the expected type for this method.       |
| `422 Unprocessable Content` | The request parameters failed validation (e.g., conflicting or malformed filters). |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | An internal error occurred. Retry or contact support if it persists.               |

For method-specific error messages and troubleshooting details, refer to the documentation for the relevant endpoint.
