All TON Center API v2 methods use a standard set of HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request.

| Status code                 | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `404 Not Found`             | The requested resource does not exist in storage.                                           |
| `405 Method Not Allowed`    | The endpoint was called with an unsupported HTTP method. Use GET or POST.                   |
| `409 Conflict`              | The resource was found but does not match the expected type for this method.                |

| `504 Gateway Timeout`       | The liteserver did not respond in time. Retry the request.                                  |
