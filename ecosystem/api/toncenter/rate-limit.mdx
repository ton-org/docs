import {Aside} from "/snippets/aside.jsx";

To ensure stability and fair access, TON Center applies rate limits to all API requests.\
If an application exceeds these limits, the API returns a `429` response.

Increase limits by [requesting an API key](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/get-api-key) and selecting a higher subscription plan.
Without any API key, the default rate limit is 1 request per second.

## Default limits

| Plan           | Tokens per Network | Requests per Second | Notes                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**       | 1                  | 10                  | Shared liteservers, ideal for quick tests and small projects.                                               |
| **Plus**       | 3                  | 25                  | Private liteservers for more consistent performance.                                                        |
| **Advanced**   | 10                 | 100                 | Private infrastructure with priority routing.                                                               |
| **Enterprise** | Custom             | Custom              | Tailored throughput and support. Contact [@toncenter\_support](https://t.me/toncenter_support) for details. |

Rate limits apply to all API keys in total separately for every TON network (mainnet/testnet). For example, the Plus plan users can create three API keys for the mainnet. The total limit for these three keys will be 25 requests per second.

<Aside>
  Each token represents an individual API key used to authenticate requests.
  Plans differ by how many tokens can be generated per network (mainnet and testnet).
  For example, the "Free" plan allows 1 key per network, while higher plans provide multiple keys for separate apps or environments.

## Rate limit exceeded

When requests are sent faster than the allowed rate limit, the TON Center API temporarily blocks new ones.
A JSON response indicates the rate limit was exceeded:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "result": "Ratelimit exceed",
  "code": 429
}
```

When this occurs:

- Stop sending new requests and wait a few seconds before retrying.
- Implement exponential backoff to avoid repeated rate-limit violations.

## Troubleshooting

If a paid plan is active but the rate remains 1 RPS:

- Check that your API key is included correctly in your requests.
  Requests without a valid API key are limited to 1 RPS, even if a subscription is active.

- Verify the correct key is used for the intended environment (mainnet or testnet).
  Each network requires its own key.

Wait up to 10 minutes after upgrading the plan or changing the API key.
Subscription and key updates can take several minutes to propagate across TON Center’s rate-limiting system.
