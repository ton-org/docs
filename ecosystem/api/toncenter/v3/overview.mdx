The TON Center API v3 provides developer access to the TON blockchain through an indexed data layer.
It allows applications to read blockchain data, run analytical queries, retrieve historical information,
and decode Jetton, NFT, and action data.

API v3 serves as the indexed access layer.

It reads raw data from a node’s RocksDB storage, parses and decodes it, and stores it in PostgreSQL.

## Typical use cases

- Query historical transactions and traces  
- Retrieve decoded Jetton and NFT data  
- Run analytical or filtered searches across multiple accounts  
- Power explorers or reporting tools

## How to access the API

Developers can access TON Center API v3 either through hosted infrastructure or by running a self-hosted instance.

### Managed Service

Hosted access uses TON Center’s indexed infrastructure.  
Requests without an API key are rate-limited to a default value.

To increase limits, generate an [API key](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/get-api-key) and select a [plan](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/rate-limit).

### Self-hosted service

Run a self-hosted API v3 setup for full control over performance and data retention. 
See the [ton-indexer](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer) repository for setup instructions.
