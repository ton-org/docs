title: Overview
---

The TON Center API v2 provides developer access to the TON blockchain through 
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) and [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC) endpoints.
It allows applications to read blockchain data, run smart contract methods, and send transactions.

API v2 serves as a non-indexed access layer.  

Applications interact with the TON blockchain by connecting to a TON node.  
Since nodes communicate through the binary ADNL protocol, an intermediate layer
is needed for web-based access. API v2 provides this bridge by using [`tonlib`](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/tonlib/tonlib)
to query data from liteservers and exposes it through a standard REST interface.

## Base URLs

| API        | Mainnet                        | Testnet                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **API v2** | `https://toncenter.com/api/v2` | `https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2` |

## Versioning

API v2 uses semantic versioning in the format `a.b.c` (for example, `2.1.1`):

| Segment | Example | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Major** | `2.x.x` | Fixed at `2` to avoid confusion ("API v2 v3.x.x"). Will not change. |
| **Minor** | `2.1.x` | Implementation variant: `0` = Python version, `1` = C++ version. |
| **Patch** | `2.1.1` | Bumped with every release on GitHub. |

## Typical use cases

- Query account balances and state  
- Run get-methods on smart contracts  
- Send or broadcast messages  
- Retrieve latest transactions and block information

## How to access the API

Developers can access API v2 either through hosted infrastructure managed by TON Center or by running a self-hosted instance.

### Managed Service

Hosted access uses TON Center’s managed infrastructure instead of running a personal node. This approach enables
immediate network access without setup or maintenance.

Requests without an API key are limited to a default rate of 1 request per second.

To increase this limit or access private liteservers, generate an [API key](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/get-api-key) and [choose a plan](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/rate-limit).

### Self-hosted service

Run a self-hosted TON Center API v2 infrastructure for full control over performance and data retention. 
See the [API v2](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api) repository for setup instructions.
