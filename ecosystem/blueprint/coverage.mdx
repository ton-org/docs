<Aside>
  This page covers coverage calculated on TVM assembly instructions. Path- and source-line coverage is not implemented.
</Aside>

There are two main ways to calculate coverage of your `@ton/sandbox` tests.

## Easy way

<Aside type="caution">
  For this way to work correctly, version of `@ton/sandbox >= 0.37.2` and `@ton/blueprint >= 0.41.0` is needed.
</Aside>

When using blueprint, the only thing you need to collect coverage is to run

```bash
blueprint test --coverage
```

Results will appear in `coverage/` directory as HTML files with reports for each of your contracts.

## Customizable way

There might be some reasons why you don't want to simply use `--coverage`.

- You don't want to collect coverage for all contracts.
- You use `@ton/sandbox` but don't use `@ton/blueprint`.
- Not all contracts have source code. (For example, for each transaction you deploy a new contract, and you don't have wrappers for it).
- You want to get the raw data and customize the output.

### 1. Enable coverage collection

Before running tests, add `blockchain.enableCoverage()` to collect coverage data:

```typescript
import {Blockchain} from '@ton/sandbox';

describe('Contract Tests', () => {
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let contract: SandboxContract<MyContract>;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        blockchain.enableCoverage();
        // or for COVERAGE=true mode only
        // blockchain.enableCoverage(process.env["COVERAGE"] === "true");

        // Deploy your contract
        contract = blockchain.openContract(MyContract.fromInit());
        // ... deployment logic
    });

    // Your tests here...
});
```

### 2. Collect coverage after tests

```typescript
afterAll(() => {
    const coverage = blockchain.coverage(contract);
    console.log(coverage?.summary());
})
```

### 3. Generate reports

```typescript
import {writeFileSync} from 'fs';

afterAll(() => {
    const coverage = blockchain.coverage(contract);
    if (!coverage) return;

    // Generate HTML report for detailed analysis
    const htmlReport = coverage.report("html");
    writeFileSync("coverage.html", htmlReport);

    // Print text text report to console
    const textReport = coverage.report("text");
    console.log(textReport);
});
```

## Understanding coverage data

### Coverage summary

The coverage summary provides key metrics about your test coverage:

```typescript
const summary = coverage.summary();

console.log(`Total lines: ${summary.totalLines}`);
console.log(`Covered lines: ${summary.coveredLines}`);
console.log(`Coverage percentage: ${summary.coveragePercentage.toFixed(2)}%`);
console.log(`Total gas consumed: ${summary.totalGas}`);
console.log(`Total hits: ${summary.totalHits}`);

// Instruction-level statistics
summary.instructionStats.forEach(stat => {
    console.log(`${stat.name}: ${stat.totalHits} hits, ${stat.totalGas} gas, avg ${stat.avgGas}`);
});
```

### Coverage reports

- **HTML Report**: Interactive report with highlighting and line-by-line coverage details
- **Text Report**: Console-friendly report with coverage information and marked code

## Advanced usage patterns

### Multiple test suites

When running multiple test files, you might want to merge coverage data:

```typescript
// In first test file
const coverage1 = blockchain.coverage(contract);
if (!coverage1) return;
const coverage1Json = coverage1.toJson();
writeFileSync("coverage1.json", coverage1Json);

// In second test file
const coverage2 = blockchain.coverage(contract);
if (!coverage2) return;
const coverage2Json = coverage2.toJson();
writeFileSync("coverage2.json", coverage2Json);

// Merge coverage data in separate script after tests
const savedCoverage1 = Coverage.fromJson(readFileSync("coverage1.json", "utf-8"));
const savedCoverage2 = Coverage.fromJson(readFileSync("coverage2.json", "utf-8"));
const totalCoverage = savedCoverage1.mergeWith(savedCoverage2);

console.log(`Combined coverage: ${totalCoverage.summary().coveragePercentage}%`);
```

## Coverage for multiple contracts

When testing systems with multiple contracts:

```typescript not runnable
describe('Multi-Contract System', () => {
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let contract1: SandboxContract<Contract1>;
    let contract2: SandboxContract<Contract2>;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();
        blockchain.enableCoverage();

        // Deploy multiple contracts
        contract1 = blockchain.openContract(Contract1.fromInit());
        contract2 = blockchain.openContract(Contract2.fromInit());
    });

    afterAll(() => {
        // Get coverage for each contract separately
        const coverage1 = blockchain.coverage(contract1);
        const coverage2 = blockchain.coverage(contract2);

        if (!coverage1 || !coverage2) return;

        console.log('Contract 1 Coverage:', coverage1.summary().coveragePercentage);
        console.log('Contract 2 Coverage:', coverage2.summary().coveragePercentage);

        // Generate separate reports
        writeFileSync("contract1-coverage.html", coverage1.report("html"));
        writeFileSync("contract2-coverage.html", coverage2.report("html"));
    });
});
```

## Interpret results

The usual report looks like this:

<Image
  src="/resources/images/coverage-report.png"
/>

Apart from the header statistics, the line-by-line coverage report is the most informative. Most fields are self‑explanatory; the code section shows per‑instruction hit counts (blue) and gas cost (red). This helps you analyze both coverage and gas efficiency.

## Limitations

Note that when code of other contracts is stored directly in the code of contract ([Tact](/language/tact) does that automatically if a contract system does not contain circular dependencies), that affects the overall code coverage percentage.

To mitigate this effect in coverage estimation, add a circular dependency. For example, import a file with the following content.

```tact
contract A {
    receive() {
        let x = initOf B();
        drop2(x);
    }
}

contract B(
) {
    receive() {
        let x = initOf A();
        drop2(x);
    }
}

asm fun drop2(x: StateInit) {
    DROP2
}
```
