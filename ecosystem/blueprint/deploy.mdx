title: "Deployment and interaction"
---

Following development and testing, contracts can be deployed and interacted with. This section outlines deployment scripts, provider configuration, and interaction workflows.

## Running scripts

Blueprint allows you to run scripts directly from the project.

1. Place your script in the `scripts/` folder.
1. Each script file must export a `run` function:
   ```typescript
   export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider, args: string[]) {
     //
   }
   ```
1. Run the script with: `npx blueprint run <SCRIPT> [arg1, arg2, ...]` command.

## Deploying contracts

To deploy a smart contract, create a deployment script in `scripts/deploy<Contract>.ts` with the following content.

```typescript title="./scripts/deploy<Contract>.ts" expandable
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { MyContract } from '../wrappers/MyContract';
import { compile, NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';

export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
    const myContract = provider.open(MyContract.createFromConfig({}, await compile('MyContract')));

    await myContract.sendDeploy(provider.sender(), toNano('0.05'));

    await provider.waitForDeploy(myContract.address);

    // run methods on `myContract`
}
```

### Interactive mode

To launch a guided prompt to create a contract step by step, use:

```bash
npx blueprint run
```

### Non-interactive mode

To create a contract without prompts, provide the contract name and template type:

```bash
npx blueprint run deploy<CONTRACT> --<NETWORK> --<DEPLOY_METHOD>
```

**Example:**

```bash
npx blueprint run deployCounter --mainnet --tonconnect
```

## Deploying methods

### Mnemonic provider

Run scripts with a wallet using mnemonic authentication by configuring environment variables and specifying the `--mnemonic` for a non-interactive method.

**Required variables:**

Set the following variables in the `.env` file:

- `WALLET_MNEMONIC` — wallet mnemonic phrase (space-separated words).
- `WALLET_VERSION` — wallet contract version.
- **Supported versions:** `v1r1`, `v1r2`, `v1r3`, `v2r1`, `v2r2`, `v3r1`, `v3r2`, `v4r1`, `v4r2` (or `v4`), `v5r1`.

```env
WALLET_MNEMONIC="word1 word2 ... word24"   # Your wallet's mnemonic phrase
WALLET_VERSION="v4r2"                      # Wallet contract version
```

**Optional variables:**

- `WALLET_ID` — wallet ID for versions earlier than `v5r1`, excluding `v5r1`.
- `SUBWALLET_NUMBER` — subwallet number for `v5r1` wallets.

_See the [wallet v5 reference](https://github.com/ton-org/ton/blob/master/src/wallets/v5r1/WalletV5R1WalletId.ts) for `WALLET_ID` construction._

Once your environment is set up, you can use the mnemonic wallet for deployment with the appropriate configuration.

### TON Connect

Run scripts with a wallet using TON Connect by specifying the `--tonconnect` option.

**Steps:**

1. After running the command, select a wallet from the available options.
1. Scan the generated QR code in your wallet app or open the provided link.
1. Confirm the transaction in the wallet's interface.

Once confirmed, the contract is deployed.

## Interaction

After deploying your contracts, you can interact with them using Blueprint scripts. These scripts use the [wrappers](/ecosystem/blueprint/develop#wrappers) you've created to send messages and call get methods on your deployed contracts.

To run the following scripts, refer to the [Running scripts](#runningscripts) section.

### Sending messages

To send [messages](/foundations/transaction) to your deployed contracts, create a script that calls the `send` methods defined in your wrapper. These methods trigger contract execution and modify the contract's state.

```typescript title="./scripts/sendIncrease.ts"
import { Address, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { MyContract } from '../wrappers/MyContract';
import { NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';

const contractAddress = Address.parse('<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>');

export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
    const myContract = provider.open(MyContract.createFromAddress(contractAddress));

    await myContract.sendIncrease(provider.sender(), {
        value: toNano('0.05'),
        increaseBy: 42
    });

    await provider.waitForLastTransaction();
    console.log('Message sent successfully!');
}
```

### Executing get methods

Get methods allow you to read data from your deployed contracts without creating transactions. These methods are free to call and don't modify the contract's state.

```typescript title="./scripts/getCounter.ts"
import { Address } from '@ton/core';
import { MyContract } from '../wrappers/MyContract';
import { NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';

const contractAddress = Address.parse('<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>');

export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
    const myContract = provider.open(MyContract.createFromAddress(contractAddress));

    const counter = await myContract.getCounter();
    const id = await myContract.getId();

    console.log('Counter:', counter);
    console.log('ID:', id);
}
```
