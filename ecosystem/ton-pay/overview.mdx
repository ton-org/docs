TON Pay SDK is a developer toolkit for integrating payment functionality on the TON blockchain. It supports web applications, [Telegram Mini Apps](/ecosystem/tma/overview), backend services, and bots. The SDK provides a unified interface for creating, verifying, and managing payments, abstracting blockchain-specific logic.

## Features

- Payment creation: one-time transfers, recurring payments, and subscriptions, with
  customizable reference IDs and memo fields.
- Transaction tracking: transaction status tracking, confirmation handling, error reporting, and
  analytics.
- UI components: React hooks, ready-to-use payment components, and built-in
  status indicators.

## How TON Pay works

The payment flow consists of these steps:

1. Transaction creation: TON Pay backend generates a transaction message.
1. Wallet signing: the user reviews and signs the transaction in the wallet.
1. Confirmation: the transaction is executed and confirmed on the TON blockchain.
1. Notification: TON Pay backend monitors the transaction status and sends webhook notifications to the application upon completion.

## Security

- Non-custodial: funds always remain under user control.
- Standard protocols: built on proven TON standards.
- Transparency: all transactions are verifiable on-chain.

## Next steps
