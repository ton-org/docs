## Create a wallet

To create a new wallet:

1. Open Tonkeeper
2. Select **Create new wallet**
3. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation
4. Add a name for your wallet
5. Click on **Back up your recovery phrase** and save the 24-word mnemonic phrase that will be shown to you.

### For Testnet

Tonkeeper requires a mainnet wallet before creating a testnet account. The testnet account is derived from your existing wallet's mnemonic.

To add a testnet account:

1. From the main screen, tap your **wallet name**
2. Select **Add Wallet → Testnet Account**

3. Enter your saved 24-word mnemonic and click **Continue**. This will create your testnet wallet account.

## Deploy wallet

When you first create a wallet in Tonkeeper, the wallet address on the blockchain is in the *nonexist* state. The address has no associated code, data, or balance.

To see your activity on the blockchain, insert your address into the search bar of the explorer [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/). You can see that the address shows as *nonexist*.

<img src="/resources/images/tonkeeper/nonexist.png" alt="Nonexist state in explorer" />

<Note>When using testnet, you should manually change the explorer mode to the testnet version: [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).</Note> 

To move from *nonexist* to *active*, you need to deploy your wallet on-chain. But first, you need to receive TON.

- For testnet, you can request funds from the [TON testnet faucet](link-to-testnet-coins-guide) completely for free
- For mainnet, use the buy button in the app or ask someone to send Toncoin to your address

After receiving your coins, your wallet address will be in the *uninit* state. This means the address has received funds but the contract hasn't been deployed yet.

With TON in your account, you can now deploy your wallet. We will be using the testnet version to send the first transaction to ourselves and see how it looks on the blockchain.

1. Open Tonkeeper and tap **Send**
2. Enter your own wallet address
3. Specify the amount, add comment if neeed and click **Continue**

4. Review the transaction details and click **Confirm**
5. Confirm the transaction with your PIN

Once the transaction is confirmed, your wallet contract will be deployed on-chain and become *active*. You can verify this by using [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/).

<img src="/resources/images/tonkeeper/active.png" alt="Active wallet in explorer" />

In the explorer, your contract should now look something like this:

- Address: Your account's unique ID (e.g., `QQB...1g6VdFEg`)
- Balance: Current Toncoin amount
- Type: Contract version (e.g., `wallet_v5r1` – detected automatically by code)
- State: Active


## Transfer jettons

If you hold [jettons](/standard/tokens/jettons/overview) in your wallet, you can send them to another person.

<Note> You need at least 0.1 TON to cover transaction fees.</Note>

1. In Tonkeeper, go to the wallet main screen and tap on the jetton you want to send
2. Tap **Send**
3. Select the token to send
