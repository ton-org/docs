### For Testnet

Tonkeeper requires a mainnet wallet before creating a testnet account. The testnet account derives from your existing wallet's mnemonic.

To add a testnet account:

1. From the main screen, tap your **wallet name**
2. Select **Add Wallet → Testnet Account**
3. Enter your 24-word mnemonic

## Deploy wallet

Before you can use your wallet on-chain to send transactions or interact with smart contracts, you need to deploy it.

To deploy your wallet, you need TON. You can request free test coins from the [TON testnet faucet](link-to-testnet-coins-guide).

Once you have coins in your wallet:

1. Open Tonkeeper and tap **Send**
2. Enter a recipient address (you may enter your own wallet address)
3. Specify the amount
4. Confirm the transaction with your PIN

Once the transaction is confirmed, your wallet contract will be deployed on-chain and become active. You can verify this by checking your wallet address on the [Testnet explorer](https://testnet.tonscan.org/).

## Transfer NFTs

To send an NFT to another person:

1. In Tonkeeper, go to the **Collectibles** tab
2. Browse your collection and choose the specific NFT you want to send, then tap **Transfer**
3. Enter the recipient's wallet address or domain (like TON DNS), write a comment if needed, and tap **Continue**
4. Follow the prompts to confirm the transaction

Once confirmed, the NFT will be transferred to the recipient's wallet.

<Note> Always double-check all the transaction information. Once the transaction is complete, you cannot undo it.</Note>
