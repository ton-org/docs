2. Select **Create new wallet**
3. Set a PIN code for transaction confirmation
4. Add a name for your wallet

### For Testnet

Tonkeeper requires a mainnet wallet before creating a testnet account. This is because the testnet account derives from your existing wallet's mnemonic`.

To add a testnet account:

1. From the main screen, tap your **wallet name**
2. Select **Add Wallet → Testnet Account**
3. Enter your 24-word mnemonic

## Deploy wallet

Before you can use your wallet on-chain to send transactions or interact with smart contracts, you need to deploy it. 

To deploy your wallet, you need TON. For testnet, you can request free coins from the [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot).

Once you have coins in your wallet:

1. Open Tonkeeper
2. Tap **Send**
3. Enter a recipient address (for testing, you may send to yourself)
4. Specify the amount
5. Confirm the transaction with your PIN

Your wallet is now deployed and active on-chain.
