[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) is a self‑custodial mobile wallet available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tonkeeper-ton-wallet/id1587742107) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ton_keeper).
It supports regular [wallets](/standard/wallets/how-it-works), [Jettons](/standard/tokens/jettons/overview), [NFTs](/standard/tokens/nft/overview), and [TON Connect](/ecosystem/ton-connect).

## Create a wallet

A wallet is required to do any transactions on a public global network. It is the primary way to interact with the blockchain. This step-by-step guide explains how to use Tonkeeper app to create a testnet wallet account.

Testnet is used instead of mainnet, because it is more suitable for development and experimentation, and test coins can be obtained for free on testnet. The procedure works the same way on mainnet, except funds will have to be procured in a different way.

Overall procedure is:

- Generate a mnemonic (a key). It uniquely determines wallet's address, but the wallet doesn't exist on blockchain yet, i.e. is in [`nonexist`](/foundations/status#status-variety) status.
- Send some funds to the wallet's account. Now it will be in [`uninit`](/foundations/status#status-variety) status, i.e. already with some balance on it, but without any code yet.
- Deploy wallet's code to this address. Some of these funds will be used to pay for the deploy process. Now the wallet is in [`active`](/foundations/status#status-variety) status, and can be used for any purpose.

<Aside

  title="Funds at risk"
>
  Addresses of both mainnet and testnet accounts can be derived from the same mnemonic, i.e. the same key might be used for both wallets. Beware these accounts exist only in their corresponding networks.

  It's possible to forget switching to testnet, and accidentally spend real funds on mainnet.

  It's possible to accidentally transfer funds to a testnet wallet address on mainnet. These funds will be impossible to recover.

  Verify which network is used before any funds are sent.

### Switch to testnet
### Add funds into the wallet

1. Message [`@testgiver_ton_bot`](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) in [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).
1. Press the Start button or send `/start` message.
1. Pass the captcha test.
1. Enter and send the testnet wallet address displayed by wallet.ton.org.
1. Soon after the "Request added to the queue" response, 2 TON will be sent to the wallet.
1. There won't be any other message that the transfer happened. [Use an explorer](#check-the-account-state) to check the request status.
1. The account should be in the `uninit` status now.

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_uninit_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>
### Deploy the code
## Check the account state

Use a [blockchain explorer](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) to inspect the account. For **Testnet**, use [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Paste the wallet address into the search bar.<br /><Image src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_light.png" darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_dark.png" alt="Insert address in Tonviewer search" />

1. The account details will appear. In a newly created wallet, the status is `nonexist`, indicating the wallet is not deployed.<br /><Image src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_light.png" darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_dark.png" alt="Account status: nonexist" />
