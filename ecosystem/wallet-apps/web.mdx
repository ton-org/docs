[wallet.ton.org](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-wallet) is the self-custodial wallet developed by TON Core.
It supports jettons, NFTs, [TON DNS](/services/dns), [TON Sites](/services/sites), [TON Proxy](/services/proxy), and is available as a web app and browser extension.

## Key features

- **Testnet support:** accepts the `testnet` parameter in the browser.
- **Supports [W5](/standard/wallets/v5)**: the latest wallet smart contract standard for TON Blockchain.

## Wallet setup

To get started, set up your [wallet.ton.org](https://wallet.ton.org/), a web-based wallet interface.

1. Open [wallet.ton.org](https://wallet.ton.org/).

1. Click "Create Wallet" to create a new wallet.

  alt="Web wallet welcome page"

4. Set and confirm your password.
   Ensure you use a _strong and unique_ password to protect your wallet.

  alt="Password setup"

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/responsibility_dark.png"
  alt="Use responsibility notice"
/>

6. After confirming, you’ll be prompted to manually back up your secret key.
   This key is the **only** way to recover access to your wallet if you lose your password or device.
   Click "Back Up Now" to continue.

8. Write down your 24 recovery words and store them in **a safe place**.
   _Never share them with anyone or enter them anywhere else._

<Aside
  type="danger"
  title="Secrets at risk"
>
  Anyone who sees your recovery words can take control of your wallet and move funds.
  If you suspect exposure, create a new wallet and transfer all funds immediately.
  Do not store recovery words digitally; write them down and keep them offline.
</Aside>

Once you’re ready, click "Let’s Check" to verify your recovery phrase.

  alt="Recovery words"

Then click "Continue" to finish the setup.

### Interface overview

The main screen of the wallet displays essential account information and actions.

- **Account balance (yellow box)** displays the total amount of Toncoin and other tokens held on your account.
- **Account address (red box)** is your unique account identifier, shown both as a QR code and as a base64-encoded string.

For example: `UQDDKXleckOm6CTbab3CPz0TkvbSkrlUFum_YMIa-IIfGmXk`.
You can share this address to receive TON, jettons, or NFTs.

- The **send button (green box)** opens the transfer form, allowing you to send TON or jettons to another account address.

### Wallet contract version

To check which [wallet contract version](/standard/wallets/comparison) is used:

1. Click the "Settings" icon.

<Image

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/settings_dark.png"
  alt="Settings button"
/>

2. In the "Wallet Versions", you can see which contract your wallet uses.

<Image

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/wallet_version_dark.png"
  alt="Settings button"
/>

3. Click the field to view the current version, for example, _W5_.

If you previously used older wallet contracts, such as v3 or v4, you can import them using your mnemonic phrase.

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/contract_type_dark.png"
  alt="Settings button"
/>

### Testnet

In wallet.ton.org, the **Testnet account** is derived from the **Mainnet wallet’s mnemonic**.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  The Testnet account is generated with the same **subwallet ID** as Mainnet.
</Aside>

To add a Testnet account:

1. Click the **Settings** icon.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/settings_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/settings_dark.png"
  alt="Settings button"
/>

2. In the settings window, **double-click** the wallet version number to open developer options.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/version_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/version_dark.png"
  alt="Click on version"
/>

3. In the **Developer options** panel, locate the **Networks** section and select **Testnet**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_dark.png"
  alt="Choose Testnet"
/>

4. The app automatically returns to the main screen, where the interface indicates that you’re now using **the Testnet version**.

<Aside type="note">
  Mainnet and Testnet use different user-friendly address formats —the raw address is the same, but its text representation differs.

  See [How to read and write TON addresses](/foundations/addresses/serialize#using-online-converter) for details on address formats and conversion.
</Aside>

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_version_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/testnet_version_dark.png"
  alt="Choose Testnet"
/>

_You can also check the wallet contract version in **Testnet** — the settings UI displays [the same version information](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/web#wallet-contract-version) as on Mainnet._

## Deploy a wallet

A wallet must be **deployed** before use — its account state must be **active**.

Newly created wallets have the default state **nonexist**, meaning the account has _no code, data, or balance_.

### Check the account state

Use a [blockchain explorer](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) to inspect the account. For **Testnet**, use [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/).

1. Paste your address into the search bar.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/tonviewer_dark.png"
  alt="Insert your address in Tonviewer search"
/>

2. The account details will appear. In a newly created wallet, the status is **nonexist**, indicating the wallet is not deployed.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_nonexist_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: nonexist"
/>

### Fund the wallet

A wallet must receive funds before deployment.

- On Testnet, request free Testnet Toncoins from the TON Testnet Faucet.

After receiving funds, the wallet enters the **uninit** state. This means the account has a balance, but the smart contract is not yet deployed.

<Image

  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/address_uninit_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: uninit"
/>

### Send the first transaction

With TON in the account, the wallet can be deployed. Deployment occurs when _the wallet processes its first transaction_.
In this example, we send TON to the account itself on Testnet to observe the transaction and wallet deployment on-chain.

<Aside
  type="caution"
  title="Funds at risk"
>
  On-chain transfers are irreversible — verify the recipient and amount before confirming. Use the testnet for practice; only use the mainnet when you intend to make a real transfer.
</Aside>

To send TON to your own account:

1. Click **Send**, enter your wallet address in **Recipient Address**, and the **Amount** of TON. Optionally, add a comment. Click **Send TON**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/send_coins_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/send_coins_dark.png"
  alt="Sending coins"
/>

2. In the confirmation popup, verify the transaction details and click **Confirm** if correct; otherwise, **Edit**.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/confirm_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/confirm_dark.png"
  alt="Confirm transaction"
/>

3. After confirmation, the wallet will display a notification: "Coins have been sent!"

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/notification_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/notification_dark.png"
  alt="Notification"
/>

Next, check your wallet status in the blockchain explorer.

The wallet should appear as **active**. _Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your contract!_

<Image
  src="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/active_light.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/wallets/wallet-ton-org/active_dark.png"
  alt="Account status: active"
/>

You will also see a "Contract Type" field indicating `v5`.
For details, see [Wallet v5](/standard/wallets/v5).
