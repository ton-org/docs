TonDevWallet is a open-source desktop wallet designed for development and testing. It allows you to have custom wallet ids, versions and even highload wallet as standard TonConnect wallet. You can also emulate all transactions and see logs and results before sending them to network.

## Highlights

- Seamless integration with TON Connect
- Local transaction emulation before on-chain submission.
- Manage multiple keys and wallets

## Download TonDevWallet

1. Download and install the latest release of [TonDevWallet](https://github.com/TonDevWallet/TonDevWallet/releases/tag/app-v0.7.2).
2. Launch the application and set a password to secure your wallet

## Create or Recover a Wallet
1. Click **+ New Wallet** from the top menu.
2. Choose one of the available options from the screen that suits your use case:
   - **Create random wallet** - Generate a new wallet with a 24-word mnemonic phrase
   - **From Mnemonic** - Import an existing wallet using your recovery phrase
   - **From Seed** - Import a wallet using the seed
   - **From Public Key** - Import a watch-only wallet using the public key

## Manage Wallet and Network Settings

Once your wallet is created, TonDevWallet lets you configure which network you are connected to and inspect the key details of your wallet.

Use the dropdown menu in the top left (Mainnet/Testnet) to toggle between networks depending on your use case. 

<Warning>
TonDevWallet is not safe to use in mainnet.
</Warning>

In the wallet view, you can see the wallet address in _Bounceable, Non-Bounceable, and Raw formats_ and also your _Balance_ which updates once tokens are received.

Depending on which network (Mainnet or Testnet) you are connected to, the wallet address information displayed will change. This ensures you always interact with the correct chain environment.

## Get Testnet Tokens

To test transfers, you'll need free test TON. 
- Go to [@testgiver_ton_bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) on Telegram 
- Copy your Testnet wallet address and Send it to the bot 

You'll receive 2 TON which will appear in your wallet balance.

## Transfer tokens and read transaction chart

To activate your wallet (moving it from an **init state** to an **active state**), you must send TON **to your wallet address**. This can be done by transferring tokens to your own wallet address. 

1. In your wallet view, click **Transfer**.
2. Fill in the fields as shown on screen:
   * **Recipient address** – enter your own wallet address (or another valid TON wallet if you want to test sending externally).
   * **Amount** – specify how much TON to send.
   * **Optional payload** – add a message, `stateInit`, or other advanced parameters if needed.
3. Click **Emulate** to preview the transaction before sending.

This local transaction emulation allows you to preview the results of transactions before executing them on the TON Blockchain. This feature helps you ensure the correctness of your transactions before submitting them to the blockchain.

Nothing is recorded on-chain until you explicitly approve and send. From the preview screen you can also:

* Copy the transaction hash,
* Download the transaction graph, or
* Open the transaction in a blockchain explorer.

Clicking **View Details**  on the graph opens a detailed TVM execution trace, showing exactly how the transaction would be processed step by step.

Once you are satisfied with the transaction results, click **Send** to execute the transaction on the blockchain. You can also view this transaction with the [explorer](https://testnet.tonscan.org/).
