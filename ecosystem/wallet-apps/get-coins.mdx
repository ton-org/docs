Testnet coins are used for development and testing on the TON testnet. To obtain testnet Toncoin, a testnet wallet is required.

Depending on the required amount of Toncoin, choose one of the following options:

- For regular requests of 2 TON per hour, use Telegram [Testgiver TON bot](#use-testgiver-ton-bot).
- For larger allocations of up to 5,000 TON, submit a [request form](#use-request-form).

## Use Testgiver TON Bot

1. Download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and create an account.

1. Open [`@testgiver_ton_bot`](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot) in a browser and click <kbd>Open Telegram</kbd>.

     alt="Open Telegram prompt"
   />

1. Once the bot opens, click <kbd>Start</kbd> to initiate the session.

     height={342}
     alt="Start bot screen"
   />

1. After the `/start` command is sent, the bot displays a welcome message. Click <kbd>Get 2 TON in testnet</kbd> to request test coins.

   />

1. A captcha prompt appears. Open the image to view it in full size and enter the displayed characters.

     alt="Captcha screen"
   />

1. Once the captcha is complete, enter the testnet wallet address.

     alt="Enter wallet address"
   />

   <Aside

     Verify that the pasted address belongs to the **testnet**. Mainnet and testnet addresses are distinct. See [Internal address formats](/foundations/addresses/formats#flag-definitions) for details.
   </Aside>

1. After submitting the address, a message confirms that the request is queued. Then, the bot processes it and sends 2 Toncoin in testnet.

     darkSrc="/resources/images/fund-wallet/request-confirmed-dark.png"
     alt="Request confirmed"
   />

1. No additional confirmation is sent when the request is processed.
   To confirm receipt of the testnet Toncoin, see [Verify the transfer](#verify-the-transfer).

1. To request again, open the menu in the lower-left corner, select `/get`, and repeat the steps.

   />

## Use request form

Request up to 5,000 testnet TON by completing the [token request form](https://builders.ton.org/opportunities/testnet).
The TON Foundation reviews the submission and transfers the tokens directly to the specified testnet wallet address.

## Verify the transfer

After requesting tokens, use the Tonviewer Testnet explorer to verify that the transfer occurred.

1. Open [Tonviewer Testnet](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/), enter the wallet address in the search bar, and click <kbd>Find</kbd>.

     darkSrc="/resources/images/fund-wallet/tonviewer-dark.png"
     alt="Tonviewer search"
   />

1. The explorer shows the current balance and transaction history, including the testnet Toncoin received from the bot. The account state is `uninit`, indicating that the account is not deployed.

     darkSrc="/resources/images/fund-wallet/account-uninit-dark.png"
     alt="Wallet balance showing uninit state"
   />

1. To [deploy the account](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/web#deploy-the-code) send any transaction from the wallet.
