## Operational notes

- These commands require `validator` mode to be enabled. They interact with the validator console and expect the validator wallet to be configured and funded.
- Offer hashes, complaint hashes, and election identifiers come from `status`, lite-client, or governance dashboards. Use the exact strings reported there to avoid signature failures.
- When managing collators, follow up with `setup_collator` (from collator mode) on the node that actually produces blocks. The validator-side registry maintained here determines which collators are accepted and how they behave during elections.

## Governance and elections

### `vo`

**Purpose:** Vote for one or more governance offers (configuration proposals) using the validator wallet.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
vo <offer-hash> [additional_offer_hashes...]
```

**Behavior**

- Accepts one or more offer hashes exactly as reported by commands like `status` or `ol`. Hashes are typically base64 strings.
- Fetches the full offer list, saves each voted offer locally for tracking, and submits signed votes through the validator wallet.
- Skips unknown hashes and raises an error if the vote submission fails.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
vo xKF+2Cj4wP6w2y... xKF+2Cj4wP6w2y...
```

### `ve`

**Purpose:** Cast the validator election entry for the upcoming round.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
ve
```

**Behavior**

- Runs the `Elections` helper from `mytoncore`, which prepares and sends the election request using the validator wallet.
- Reuses configuration stored in the local database (stake amount, elector parameters, etc.).
- Prints `VoteElectionEntry - OK` when the elector accepts the query.

### `vc`

**Purpose:** Vote on a validator complaint by pairing the election round with the complaint hash.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
vc <election-id> <complaint-hash>
```

**Behavior**

- `<election-id>` is the integer identifier of the round (from `status` or elector logs).
- `<complaint-hash>` is usually base64 and matches the hash reported in complaint notifications.
- Delegates to `VoteComplaint`, which signs and broadcasts the vote via the validator wallet.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
vc 345678901234567890 xFFmZ...Y
```

## Performance diagnostics

### `check_ef`

**Purpose:** Review validator efficiency for the previous and current validation rounds.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
check_ef
```

**Behavior**

- Collects validator lists for the current and previous rounds, locates the local ADNL, and prints block production statistics.
- Highlights time ranges for each round, shows created versus expected masterchain blocks, and colorizes efficiency percentages (green when ≥90%).
- Warns when efficiency data is unavailable (e.g., when the validator joined as a shard-only participant or the round has just started).

## Local collator registry

### `add_collator`

**Purpose:** Add a collator entry to the validator console’s collator list and configure optional behaviors.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
add_collator <adnl-id> <workchain>:<shard_hex> [--self-collate true|false] [--select-mode random|ordered|round_robin]
```

**Behavior**

- `<adnl-id>` accepts base64 or hex. Hex values are automatically converted to base64 before storing.
- `<workchain>:<shard_hex>` identifies the shard (e.g., `0:2000000000000000`). Use the same format shown in the validator console output.
- If the shard already exists in the collator list, the command appends the ADNL and optionally updates `self_collate` or `select_mode`. Otherwise, it creates a new shard entry using defaults (`self_collate=true`, `select_mode=random`).
- Persists the updated list using `set-collators-list` so the validator console starts assigning work to the new collator.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
add_collator 2F3C7A...B91 0:2000000000000000 --self-collate true --select-mode ordered
```

### `delete_collator`

**Purpose:** Remove one or more collator entries from the validator console list.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
delete_collator [<workchain>:<shard_hex>] <adnl-id>
```

**Behavior**

- Accepts an optional shard selector. When omitted, the ADNL is removed from every shard where it appears.
- `<adnl-id>` can be base64 or hex; hex values are converted automatically.
- After removal, the command cleans up empty shard sections in the stored collator list.

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
delete_collator 0:2000000000000000 2F3C7A...B91
delete_collator 2F3C7A...B91
```

### `print_collators`

**Purpose:** Inspect the current collator list and optional liveness information.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
print_collators [--json]
```

**Behavior**

- By default, prints the human-readable output from `show-collators-list`, augmented with online/offline status when `collation-manager-stats` provides data.
- With `--json`, returns the parsed collator list in JSON format, matching the structure passed to `set-collators-list`.

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
print_collators
print_collators --json
```

### `reset_collators`

**Purpose:** Clear the entire collator list stored in the validator console.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
reset_collators
```

**Behavior**

- Calls `clear-collators-list` and removes all shard/ADNL mappings.
- Reports an error if the console rejects the reset; otherwise, prints `reset_collators - OK`.
