title: "Liquid staking"
description: "Liquid staking mode orchestrates controller deployment and maintenance for jetton-based staking pools. The commands below cover controller lifecycle management, funding flows, validator-set updates, and diagnostic helpers."
---

## Operational notes

- Liquid staking controllers rely on the validator wallet and liquid pool contracts. Keep the wallet funded and the pool address (`liquid_pool_addr`) set via `set liquid_pool_addr <address>` before deploying controllers.
- Pending withdrawals are stored in the local database when a controller is busy (non-zero `state`). MyTonCtrl processes them automatically as soon as the controller returns to the ready state.
- The jetton pool contracts must be available under `/usr/src/mytonctrl/contracts/jetton_pool/`. The first run of `create_controllers` downloads them if necessary.
- Commands interacting with the TON HTTP Application Programming Interface (API) assume the service listens on `127.0.0.1:8801` (the default when this mode is enabled).

## Controller deployment and discovery

### `create_controllers`

**Purpose:** Deploy the two standard controllers for the configured liquid staking pool if they are missing or outdated.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
create_controllers
```

**Behavior**

- Compares the controller addresses returned by the pool (`GetControllers`) with the addresses stored in the local database.
- If they differ, downloads the jetton pool deployment scripts (on first run), signs the deployment Bag of Cells (BoC) files with the validator wallet, and sends them to the liquid pool with an attached value.
- Stores the newly active controllers under `using_controllers` so subsequent staking and voting commands target the fresh contracts.

### `update_controllers`

**Purpose:** Re-run the controller deployment workflow to synchronize with changes on the pool side.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
update_controllers
```

**Behavior**

- Alias for `create_controllers`. Useful after pool upgrades or migration, forcing MyTonCtrl to redeploy controllers when the contract-address mapping changes.

### `controllers_list`

**Purpose:** Inspect every controller list tracked locally.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
controllers_list
```

**Behavior**

- Prints tables for the active (`using`), newly detected, previously used (`old`), and user-specified controller lists.
- Each entry includes address, on-chain status, balance, approval flag, and controller state as reported by `get_validator_controller_data`.
- Allows operators to verify whether a controller is approved, funded, or stopped.

### `add_controller`

**Purpose:** Mark an additional controller address as user-managed so MyTonCtrl considers it for operations.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
add_controller <controller-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Adds `<CONTROLLER_ADDR>` to the `user_controllers` list and removes it from the stop list if present, enabling future staking or updates through MyTonCtrl.
- `<CONTROLLER_ADDR>` accepts a base64 controller address.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
add_controller EQDf...9A
```

## Funding and withdrawals

### `deposit_to_controller`

**Purpose:** Top up a controller contract with Toncoin from the validator wallet.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
deposit_to_controller <controller-addr> <amount-ton>
```

**Behavior**

- Signs the `top-up.boc` script with the validator wallet and sends `<AMOUNT_TON>` TON to `<CONTROLLER_ADDR>`.
- Use decimal TON amounts. The command handles conversion to nanotons internally.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
deposit_to_controller EQDf...9A 2000
```

### `withdraw_from_controller`

**Purpose:** Withdraw funds from a controller back to the validator wallet.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_controller <controller-addr> [amount-ton]
```

**Behavior**

- Requests an immediate withdrawal when the controller state permits it, otherwise queues a pending withdrawal handled automatically later.
- If `<AMOUNT_TON>` is omitted, MyTonCtrl withdraws nearly the entire balance (leaving \~10 TON to cover rent).

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_controller EQDf...9A
withdraw_from_controller EQDf...9A 750
```

### `stop_controller`

**Purpose:** Flag a controller so MyTonCtrl stops using it for future staking operations.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
stop_controller <controller-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Adds `<CONTROLLER_ADDR>` to the local stop list and removes it from the user or active lists. The contract remains on-chain but is ignored by automated workflows.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
stop_controller EQDf...9A
```

### `stop_and_withdraw_controller`

**Purpose:** Stop a controller and withdraw its funds in a single step.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
stop_and_withdraw_controller <controller-addr> [amount-ton]
```

**Behavior**

- Flags the controller as stopped (same as `stop_controller`).
- Triggers a withdrawal for `<AMOUNT_TON>` TON; when omitted, withdraws almost the full balance (balance minus \~10.1 TON to keep the contract alive).

**Example**

```mytonctrl
stop_and_withdraw_controller EQDf...9A
```

## Validator-set maintenance

### `controller_update_validator_set`

**Purpose:** Refresh the validator set stored on a controller contract.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
controller_update_validator_set <controller-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Calls the controller’s `update_validator_set` method so it picks up the latest validator Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL) IDs from the pool.
- Use after elections or whenever the pool indicates mismatched validator sets.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
controller_update_validator_set EQDf...9A
```

### `check_liquid_pool`

**Purpose:** Scan recent liquid pool transactions and update controller validator sets automatically.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
check_liquid_pool
```

**Behavior**

- Looks through the liquid pool’s account history, detects controller addresses interacting with the pool, and calls `controller_update_validator_set` for each detected controller.
- Useful as a catch-up step after manual interventions or pool upgrades.

## Controller diagnostics

### `get_controller_data`

**Purpose:** Dump the full controller status in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for inspection.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
get_controller_data <controller-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Runs the controller’s `get_validator_controller_data` method and prints the resulting fields (for example: state, approval, borrowed amount, and stake timing).
- Ideal for debugging controllers stuck in a non-zero state or verifying approval.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
get_controller_data EQDf...9A
```

### `calculate_annual_controller_percentage`

**Purpose:** Convert the per-round interest rate into an annualized percentage.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
calculate_annual_controller_percentage [percent-per-round]
```

**Behavior**

- Uses the validator election cycle length from [config 15](../../../ton/config.mdx#param-15-elections-timing) to compute how many rounds fit into a year and then scales the provided (or configured `max_interest_percent`) rate.
- Prints intermediate values and the final yearly percentage.

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
calculate_annual_controller_percentage
calculate_annual_controller_percentage 1.25
```

### `test_calculate_loan_amount`

**Purpose:** Test the on-chain helper that calculates controller loan amounts.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
test_calculate_loan_amount
```

**Behavior**

- Sends a local HTTP request to the TON HTTP API (`/runGetMethod`) using the configured loan parameters (`min_loan`, `max_loan`, `max_interest_percent`).
- Prints the raw response (value in nanotons) used to size controller loans.
