title: "Custom overlays"
description: "Sets up a custom overlay to speed up synchronization for a group of nodes."

## Operational notes

- Overlays require MyTonCtrl to run in `validator` mode with an accessible validator console; the commands rely on console RPCs (`addcustomoverlay`, `showcustomoverlays`, `delcustomoverlay`).
- Keep ADNL IDs in the configuration consistent with the nodeâ€™s current validator keys. The helper refuses to deploy static overlays when the node lacks the necessary IDs.
- Dynamic overlays are re-evaluated each election. MyTonCtrl automatically removes stale overlays tied to old election IDs and creates new ones as rounds roll over.

## add\_custom\_overlay

**Purpose:** Register a custom overlay configuration and deploy it to the validator console.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
add_custom_overlay <overlay-name> <path-to-config>
```

**Behavior**

- `<overlay-name>` is an arbitrary label used inside MyTonCtrl and as the validator-console overlay name.
- `<path-to-config>` must point to a JSON file describing overlay nodes. Each key is an ADNL address (hex) and each value specifies whether the node is a `block_sender` or `msg_sender` (`msg_sender` entries may include a `msg_sender_priority`).
- Configuration files can include an `@validators` key to denote dynamic overlays. In that case, MyTonCtrl stores the config and schedules validator-console updates for the current and next election rounds.
- Static overlays are converted immediately via `addcustomoverlay` and require that your node owns the listed ADNL IDs; otherwise, the command prints an error.
- MyTonCtrl caches the config in its database, so overlays persist across restarts.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
add_custom_overlay telemetry-overlay /etc/mytonctrl/overlays/telemetry.json
```

### Sample config structure

```json
{
  "3b53...d1": { "block_sender": true },
  "@validators": ["0a1f...bc", "292e...7a"],
  "7c9d...4e": { "msg_sender": true, "msg_sender_priority": 5 }
}
```

- Keys other than `@validators` must be ADNL IDs in hex form.
- For `msg_sender` entries, set `msg_sender` to `true` and optionally include `msg_sender_priority` (higher numbers mean higher priority).
- Include `@validators` only when you want the overlay to track the current validator set automatically.

## list\_custom\_overlays

**Purpose:** Inspect every overlay definition stored by MyTonCtrl.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
list_custom_overlays
```

**Behavior**

- Prints each overlay name and the JSON configuration saved in the local database.
- Highlights whether an overlay is dynamic (`@validators` present) or static.
- Helpful for auditing definitions before deploying them on another node.

## delete\_custom\_overlay

**Purpose:** Remove a stored overlay and, when possible, detach it from the validator console.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
delete_custom_overlay <overlay-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Deletes `<overlay-name>` from the MyTonCtrl database.
- If the overlay was dynamic (tracked via `@validators`), the validator console updates within \~1 minute to remove it automatically.
- For static overlays, MyTonCtrl issues `delcustomoverlay <overlay-name>` so the validator console stops broadcasting it immediately. If the console rejects the operation, the command reports an error so you can intervene manually.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
delete_custom_overlay telemetry-overlay
```
