## Install MyTonCtrl

Run the installer as the non-root operator who will manage the node. The command below fetches dependencies, downloads the script, and starts the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl wget git ca-certificates python3-pip
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh -d
```

The wizard walks you through hardware validation, TON binary installs, and MyTonCtrl configuration. Use flags to pre-select options or automate deployments:

| Flag                                      | What it does                                                 | Typical use                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`                                      | Downloads a packaged blockchain dump before first start.     | Speed up the initial sync (omit if you prefer to sync from peers only). |
| `-m validator`, `-m liteserver`           | Pre-enables the target mode.                                 | Skip switching modes manually after install.                            |
| `-n mainnet`, `-n testnet`                | Switches global config URL and minimum hardware thresholds.  | Point the node to testnet without editing configs later.                |
| `-t`                                      | Disables telemetry uploads during install.                   | Comply with policies that forbid sharing validator stats.               |
| `-i`                                      | Ignores the CPU/RAM minimum check.                           | Lab hardware or cloud instances that fall below defaults.               |
| `-c <PATH>`                               | Supplies a custom `config.json` for TON installer steps.     | Use a vetted mirror instead of the default URL.                         |
| `-v <VERSION>`                            | Pins the TON node to a branch, tag, or commit.               | Lock to a specific release when validating upgrades.                    |
| `-u <USER>`                               | Forces the operator account that owns MyTonCtrl.             | Keep ownership correct when running the script from automation.         |
| `-a <AUTHOR>`, `-r <REPO>`, `-b <BRANCH>` | Override the Git source for MyTonCtrl and installer scripts. | Test forks or feature branches.                                         |
| `-p <FILE>`                               | Restore from a MyTonCtrl backup archive.                     | Reinstall on fresh hardware using an existing backup.                   |
| `-o`                                      | Install only MyTonCtrl assets (requires `-p`).               | Recover the console without touching TON binaries.                      |
| `-l`                                      | Install only the TON node binaries and services.             | Pair a fresh node with an already configured MyTonCtrl.                 |
| `-h`                                      | Prints installer help and exits.                             | Basic check of available options.                                       |

Leaving out `-m` and `-p` keeps you in the interactive CLI (`install.py`), which prompts for network selection, telemetry, and mode enablement.

### Environment variables

Set these variables before running `install.sh` (for example, `ARCHIVE_TTL=864000 sudo bash install.sh -d`) to preconfigure node behavior:

| Variable         | Effect                                                              | Notes                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHIVE_TTL`    | Overrides the retention (in seconds) passed to `--archive-ttl`.     | Defaults to `2592000` for liteserver mode and `86400` otherwise; set `-1` for effectively permanent retention. |
| `STATE_TTL`      | Sets `--state-ttl` and shortens the archive TTL by the same amount. | Use with `ARCHIVE_TTL` to keep a smaller state cache.                                                          |
| `ADD_SHARD`      | Adds one or more `--add-shard` arguments.                           | Provide shard IDs separated by spaces (for example `0:2000000000000000 0:a000000000000000`).                   |
| `ARCHIVE_BLOCKS` | Downloads archive data via TON Storage during bootstrap.            | Accepts a single block/UTC date or a range (`<from> <to>`); dates must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.                        |
| `COLLATE_SHARD`  | Configures collator shards during `collator` mode installs.         | Space-separated shard IDs; defaults to `0:8000000000000000` if unset.                                          |

## Operational notes

- All guides assume you are running the interactive `mytonctrl` console on a node where the relevant mode is enabled (`enable_mode <mode_name>`).
- Many commands trigger privileged scripts (systemd, file writes, package installs). Run them from an account that can escalate with `sudo` or the original installation user.
- Keep validator wallets, ADNL keys, and configuration backups safe before applying destructive actions (disabling modes, removing Teleport, restoring archives, etc.).

## Pick the right guide

- **Provisioning a new node?** Start with [Setup MyTonCtrl](../setup-mytonctrl) and then use the [Core](./core) and [Installer](./installer) references for ongoing maintenance.
- **Operating pools or liquid staking?** Combine the [Pools](./pools) or [Liquid Staking](./liquid_staking) guides with the relevant validator or wallet sections.
- **Keeping eyes on production nodes?** Review [Alerting](./alerting), [Backups](./backups), and [Utilities](./utilities) so you can monitor and recover your infrastructure quickly.
