title: "Nominator pools"
description: "Pool-focused commands help you manage validator-run nominator pools and Orbs single-nominator pools. The console exposes utilities that create local pool descriptors, deploy the contracts on-chain, and move stake in or out."

## Shared pool utilities

### `pools_list`

**Purpose:** Display every pool tracked locally along with its status on-chain.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
pools_list
```

**Behavior**

- Queries the MyTonCtrl database for all pool descriptors stored under `/var/ton-work/pools`.
- Resolves each pool’s smart-contract account status and balance; if an account is inactive, it falls back to the deployment (init) address.
- Prints a table with columns `Name`, `Status`, `Balance`, `Version`, and `Address` so you can quickly audit which pools are deployed and funded.

### `import_pool`

**Purpose:** Register an existing pool by saving its address inside the local pools directory.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
import_pool <pool-name> <pool-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Accepts a local alias (`<pool-name>`) and the pool’s base64 (bounceable) smart-contract address.
- Creates `<pool-name>.addr` in the pools directory so other commands (activation, deposits, withdrawals) can reference it.
- Downloads the pool contract scripts on demand if they are not present yet.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
import_pool my-pool EQC02...fa8
```

### `delete_pool`

**Purpose:** Remove the local metadata for a pool you no longer manage.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
delete_pool <pool-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Deletes the BOC/address files created for `<pool-name>` from the pools directory; on-chain contracts remain untouched.
- Useful when you migrate a pool to another host or retire a test deployment.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
delete_pool my-pool
```

## Nominator pool operations (`nominator-pool` mode)

### `new_pool`

**Purpose:** Generate deployment artifacts for a standard nominator pool before broadcasting it.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
new_pool <pool-name> <validator-reward-share-percent> <max-nominators-count> <min-validator-stake-ton> <min-nominator-stake-ton>
```

**Behavior**

- Creates `<pool-name>.addr` and `<pool-name>-query.boc` using the official nominator pool Fift scripts.
- `<validator-reward-share-percent>` is the operator commission (e.g., `10.5` for 10.5%).
- `<max-nominators-count>` is the maximum number of nominators the pool will accept.
- `<min-validator-stake-ton>` and `<min-nominator-stake-ton>` define the minimum validator self-stake and delegator stake in TON (whole-ton values are expected; convert to nanoTON before use if you need fractional amounts).
- Validates that no other local pool shares the same derived address.
- Does not submit anything to the blockchain; run `activate_pool` afterward.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
new_pool mypool 12.5 100 300000 1000
```

### `activate_pool`

**Purpose:** Deploy the nominator pool contract created via `new_pool` or `import_pool`.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
activate_pool <pool-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Loads `<pool-name>-query.boc` and ensures the validator wallet is active.
- If the pool account is still empty, it signs and broadcasts the deployment message; if it is already active, it logs a warning and exits without changes.
- Leaves the deployment BOC in place so you can retry if the transaction fails.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
activate_pool mypool
```

### `update_validator_set`

**Purpose:** Refresh the validator address list stored in the pool contract after elections or operator changes.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
update_validator_set <pool-addr>
```

**Behavior**

- Uses the validator wallet to call the pool’s `update_validator_set` method.
- `<pool-addr>` must be the pool’s bounceable address as reported by `pools_list` or `status`.
- Typically run after activating the pool or when the validator ADNL set changes.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
update_validator_set EQB1e...6g
```

### `deposit_to_pool`

**Purpose:** Stake Toncoin from the validator wallet into the pool contract.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
deposit_to_pool <pool-addr> <amount-ton>
```

**Behavior**

- Builds a validator deposit query, signs it with the validator wallet, and sends it to `<pool-addr>`.
- `<amount-ton>` is a TON-denominated float or integer. Internally, the command converts it to the correct nanoTON amount.
- Useful for seeding the validator share or topping up the pool’s liquidity.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
deposit_to_pool EQB1e...6g 1000
```

### `withdraw_from_pool`

**Purpose:** Withdraw Toncoin from a nominator pool back to the validator wallet.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_pool <pool-addr> <amount-ton>
```

**Behavior**

- Checks the pool state; if withdrawals are currently unlocked, it performs an immediate withdrawal, otherwise it submits a pending withdrawal request that will execute once the pool cycle allows it.
- `<amount-ton>` is specified in TON.
- Requires that the validator wallet has the authority to trigger the withdrawal.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_pool EQB1e...6g 250
```

## Single nominator pool operations (`single-nominator` mode)

### `new_single_pool`

**Purpose:** Prepare deployment assets for an Orbs single-nominator pool.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner-address>
```

**Behavior**

- Generates `<pool-name>.addr` and `<pool-name>-query.boc` using the bundled Orbs single-nominator contract templates.
- `<owner-address>` is the delegator’s smart-contract or wallet address (bounceable base64 or workchain:hex format supported by TON tools).
- The validator wallet address is embedded automatically as the operator.
- Ensures no other local pool produces the same address.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
new_single_pool vip-client EQCrn...u3
```

### `activate_single_pool`

**Purpose:** Broadcast the state-init produced by `new_single_pool` to deploy the contract.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Checks that `<pool-name>-query.boc` still exists (indicating the pool is not already active).
- Signs the deploy message with the validator wallet and posts it to the network.
- Warns and exits without changes if the BOC is missing because the pool was already activated.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
activate_single_pool vip-client
```

### `withdraw_from_single_pool`

**Purpose:** Withdraw Toncoin from a single-nominator pool back to the validator wallet or owner as configured.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_single_pool <pool-addr> <amount-ton>
```

**Behavior**

- Issues an immediate withdrawal request against `<pool-addr>` for `<amount-ton>` TON.
- Uses `WithdrawFromPoolProcess`, which executes in the current cycle without creating a pending queue.
- Primarily used to return delegated funds or distribute rewards.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
withdraw_from_single_pool EQCsd...9k 50
```

## Activation and funding prerequisites

- Enable the appropriate mode (`enable_mode nominator-pool` or `enable_mode single-nominator`) before using these commands; each mode mounts its own command set.
- Ensure your validator wallet is active and funded because deployment, deposits, and withdrawals all originate from it.
- For new pools, review the generated `.addr` and `-query.boc` files and keep secure backups—deletion removes these local artifacts.
