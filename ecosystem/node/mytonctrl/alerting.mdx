title: "Alerts"
description: "The alert-bot module integrates with Telegram to notify operators about node issues. The commands below help you configure, inspect, and test alerts."

## Operational notes

- Alerts cover wallet balance thresholds, database usage, validator efficiency/blocks, synchronization, ADNL health, stake acceptance, slashes, and other key metrics. Review the alert keys in `modules/alert_bot.py` to understand the available triggers.
- Each alert has an associated cooldown (`timeout`) to prevent spam. Info-level ok alerts reset state without sound notifications.
- The bot requires network access to the Telegram API. Ensure outbound HTTPS is permitted from the server.
- When validator mode is enabled, the alert bot automatically includes wallet and ADNL context in messages. In collator-only or other modes, some alerts may be skipped because prerequisites are missing.

## setup\_alert\_bot

**Purpose:** Configure the alert bot with the Telegram bot token and chat ID, then start sending events.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
setup_alert_bot
```

**Behavior**

- Launches the alert-bot configuration flow (interactive prompts) to store `BotToken` and `ChatId` in the local database.
- Validates the token by sending test requests; fails fast if the bot or chat ID is incorrect.
- Should be run after enabling `alert-bot` mode so the background scheduler picks up the alerts.

## list\_alerts

**Purpose:** Show all predefined alerts and whether they are currently enabled.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
list_alerts
```

**Behavior**

- Lists every alert key (for example: `low_wallet_balance`, `db_usage_80`, `out_of_sync`) along with the enabled flag and the UNIX timestamp when it was last sent.
- Helps you audit which alerts are muted and whether recent warnings have fired.

## enable\_alert

**Purpose:** Re-enable a previously muted alert.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
enable_alert <alert_name>
```

**Behavior**

- Accepts any alert key defined in the alert module (for example: `low_efficiency`, `service_down`, `validator_slashed`).
- Sets the alert’s `enabled` flag to `true` so future events can trigger notifications.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
enable_alert low_wallet_balance
```

## disable\_alert

**Purpose:** Temporarily suppress a specific alert.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
disable_alert <alert_name>
```

**Behavior**

- Marks the alert as disabled; the scheduler skips sending messages for it until re-enabled.
- Use when you expect noisy conditions (e.g., during planned maintenance) but still want other alerts to deliver.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
disable_alert service_down
```

## test\_alert

**Purpose:** Send a simple message through the configured alert channel to verify connectivity.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
test_alert
```

**Behavior**

- Requires successful initialization (bot token and chat ID saved). If initialization hasn’t run yet, the command triggers it.
- Sends `Test alert` with `info` severity so you can confirm the chat receives notifications.

### Available alert names

- `low_wallet_balance`: Validator wallet balance below 10 TON while the node is working and in sync.
- `low_wallet_balance_ok`: Balance recovered to ≥10 TON after a low-balance alert.
- `db_usage_80`: TON database usage exceeded 80% (but ≤95%).
- `db_usage_95`: TON database usage exceeded 95%.
- `db_usage_ok`: Database usage dropped back below 80% after a high-usage alert.
- `low_efficiency`: Validator efficiency fell below 90% once ≥80% of the round elapsed.
- `out_of_sync`: Node stayed more than 20 seconds behind the masterchain while otherwise running.
- `sync_ok`: Node resynced to less than 20 seconds lag after an out-of-sync alert.
- `service_down`: Validator service stopped reporting as working (outside of initial sync).
- `service_down_ok`: Validator service resumed normal operation after downtime.
- `adnl_connection_failed`: Remote ADNL connectivity checks failed for all probe hosts.
- `adnl_connection_ok`: ADNL check succeeded again after a failure.
- `zero_block_created`: No blocks produced in roughly the last half validation period (\~8h on mainnet).
- `zero_block_created_ok`: Block production resumed after a zero-block alert.
- `validator_slashed`: Validator was slashed in the previous validation round.
- `stake_not_accepted`: Election stake submission was rejected (validator missing from the current validator list).
- `stake_accepted`: Election stake was accepted (validator present in the current validator list).
- `stake_returned`: Elector returned the stake during the post-freeze payout window.
- `stake_not_returned`: Stake was not returned during the expected post-freeze payout window.
- `voting`: Governance offers with ≥50% approval remain unvoted by this validator.
- `voting_ok`: All actionable governance offers have been voted on (no outstanding votes).
- `initial_sync_completed`: Initial blockchain sync finished successfully.
- `shard_collators_offline`: All registered collators for at least one shard are offline.
- `shard_collators_ok`: Collators for previously offline shards reported back online.
