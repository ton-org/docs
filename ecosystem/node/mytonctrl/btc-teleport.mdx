title: "BTC Teleport"
description: "The BTC Teleport module manages the optional Bitcoin bridge (Teleport) client shipped with MyTonCtrl. Use these commands to inspect proposals, vote on them, or remove the Teleport installation when no longer needed."
---

## Operational notes

- Teleport installation happens automatically when validator mode is enabled unless `btcTeleportDisabled` is set. Use these commands to check governance participation or clean up.
- Voting attaches 1.5 TON from the validator wallet. Ensure the wallet has sufficient balance before sending votes.
- The module caches proposals it has voted on (`saveOffersBtcTeleport`) to avoid duplicate submissions.

## `remove_btc_teleport`

**Purpose:** Uninstall the Teleport binaries, keystore, and system service.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
remove_btc_teleport [--force]
```

<Caution>`--force` removes Teleport binaries and service configuration.
Risk: loss of Teleport state; service downtime.
Scope: this node’s Teleport installation (binaries, keystore, systemd unit).
Rollback/Mitigation: reinstall Teleport or restore from a backup of `/usr/src/ton-teleport-btc-periphery` and related configs.
Environment: applies to both TON Testnet and TON Mainnet nodes.</Caution>

**Behavior**

- Runs `scripts/remove_btc_teleport.sh` to delete the Teleport repository (`/usr/src/ton-teleport-btc-periphery`), keystore, and systemd service.
- By default, it refuses to run if the validator is currently a masterchain participant. Use `--force` only when the node is not producing masterchain blocks or after exiting the validator set.
- Prints an error if the removal script fails.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
remove_btc_teleport --force
```
