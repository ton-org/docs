## Operational notes

- MyTonCtrl stores wallets under `/var/ton-work/wallets`. Back up `.pk` files securely before deleting or migrating wallets.
- Generated wallet names follow the `wallet_###` pattern. Use `wl` to find the correct name before funding or exporting.
- Bookmark support depends on entries configured via other modules (for example, utility commands that register shortcuts).
- Transfers rely on the validator console and may require the wallet to be active with sufficient rent balance (>0.1 TON).

## Wallet lifecycle

### `nw`

**Purpose:** Create a new local wallet definition and show its deployment address.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
nw [<workchain-id> <wallet-name> [<version> <subwallet>]]
```

**Behavior**

- With no arguments, autogenerates a name (`wallet_XXX`), uses workchain `0`, selects version `v1`, and derives subwallet `698983191 + workchain`.
- When arguments are provided, you must supply the workchain and name; optional `version` (`v1`, `v2`, `v3`) and `subwallet` override defaults.
- Writes `.addr`/`.pk` files under the wallets directory and prints a table with the new wallet address (state-init form).

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
nw
nw 0 treasury v3 1001
```

### `aw`

**Purpose:** Deploy one wallet or all wallets that have unsigned deployment BoCs.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
aw [<wallet-name>|all]
```

**Behavior**

- Without arguments, treats the request as `all` and scans every wallet for pending deployment BoCs, sending them if the target address still has a positive balance.
- With a wallet name, activates that specific wallet using the stored deployment message.

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
aw
aw wallet_005
```

### `wl`

**Purpose:** List every wallet known to MyTonCtrl along with its on-chain status.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
wl
```

**Behavior**

- Prints Name, Status, Balance, Version, Workchain, and Address (current or init address if inactive).
- Useful for auditing balances before elections or sweeping idle funds.

### `dw`

**Purpose:** Delete a wallet’s local files after operator confirmation.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
dw <wallet-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Prompts `Are you sure you want to delete this wallet (yes/no):` and only proceeds on `yes`.
- Removes the `.addr`, `.pk`, and cached query files for `<wallet-name>` but does not touch on-chain accounts.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
dw treasury
```

## Importing, exporting, and metadata

### `iw`

**Purpose:** Import an existing wallet by address and secret key.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
iw <wallet-addr> <wallet-secret-key-base64>
```

**Behavior**

- Writes the provided address bytes and base64-encoded private key into a new local wallet (name auto-generated).
- Prints the assigned wallet name for subsequent commands.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
iw EQDk...cQ KJ4Q...
```

### `ew`

**Purpose:** Export a wallet’s address and secret key.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
ew <wallet-name>
```

**Behavior**

- Reads the `.pk` file, base64-encodes it, and prints the address/key pair along with the wallet name.
- Useful for backups or migration to hardware wallets.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
ew treasury
```

### `swv`

**Purpose:** Update the recorded wallet version (v1/v2/v3) for an imported wallet.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
swv <wallet-addr> <wallet-version>
```

**Behavior**

- Updates metadata so MyTonCtrl selects the correct Fift script when sending transactions.
- Supply the wallet address exactly as stored (base64 or workchain:hex) and the version string.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
swv EQC0...FQ v3
```

## Fund transfers

### `mg`

**Purpose:** Send Toncoin from a local wallet to a destination address or bookmark.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
mg <wallet-name> <account-addr|bookmark> <amount> [additional-flags...]
```

**Behavior**

- `<amount>` accepts numeric TON values or the shortcuts `all` (sends balance minus fees) and `alld` (sends entire balance, including fees).
- Automatically checks the source balance, destination bounceability, and wallet version. Add `-n` to force non-bounceable mode or other validator-console flags as needed.
- Submits the signed transfer via the validator console; prints `MoveCoins - OK` on success.

**Examples**

```mytonctrl
mg treasury EQDv...Qw 1500
mg treasury bookmark_main all -n
```

### `mgtp`

**Purpose:** Relay a payment through two temporary proxy wallets before reaching the destination.

**Syntax**

```mytonctrl
mgtp <wallet-name> <account-addr|bookmark> <amount>
```

**Behavior**

- Creates two temporary wallets, hops the transfer through them (`wallet -> proxy1 -> proxy2 -> destination`), and cleans up afterward.
- Ensures the final leg includes `-n` (non-bounceable) to safely reach inactive recipients.
- Handy when the destination cannot accept a direct bounceable transfer.

**Example**

```mytonctrl
mgtp treasury EQC6...rA alld
```
