  alt="Architecture"
/>

## Step 1: Prepare environment

### 1.1 Maintain costs and expanses

- Validator node network fee spends up to 200 TON monthly.
- Validator deposit stake 700 000 TON \~ 4 000 000 TON.
- 100 TB/month traffic at a peak load.

### 1.2 Minimal hardware requirements

- 16-core CPU
- 128 GB RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD or provisioned 64+k IOPS storage
- 1 Gbit/s network connectivity
- Public IP address (fixed IP address)

<Aside type="tip">
 A 1 Gbit/s network connection is recommended to ensure reliable performance during peak load conditions. The average expected bandwidth usage is approximately 100 Mbit/s.
 Validators must carefully consider IOPS disk requirements, as insufficient storage performance can severely impact validator stability and overall network health.
</Aside>

### 1.3 Software requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS
- Python 3.10
- Clang 16.0.0

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-3.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-3.png"
  alt="Versions output"
/>

<Accordion
  title="Update Clang..."
>
  ```bash
  # Please check your clang version first
  clang --version
  # If it is of version 16 you don't need to do the below steps.

  # Required for Ubuntu 20.04 only.
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y manpages-dev software-properties-common
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc-11 g++-11

  # Required for Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04. Update current clang to clang-16
  sudo apt install lsb-release wget software-properties-common gnupg
  sudo wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add -
  wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
  chmod +x llvm.sh
  sudo ./llvm.sh 16 clang

  # change default clang
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang clang /usr/bin/clang-16 100
  sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/clang++ clang++ /usr/bin/clang++-16 100
  ```
</Accordion>

### 1.4 Port forwarding for validator

Configure your network on server according the following:

- All outgoing connections to be open.
- A static external IP address.
- One UDP port open for incoming connections.

To determine which UDP ports are open, use the following command:

```bash
netstat -tulpn
```

### 1.5 Follow network announcements

Subscribe and follow instructions provided for validators with telegram channels

<Aside type="tip">
  Do not ignore announcements for TON Testnet; validators that violate maintaining rules are fined and excluded from the network.
</Aside>

| Channel                                      | Network     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [@tonstatus](https://t.me/tonstatus)         | TON Mainnet |
| [@testnetstatus](https://t.me/testnetstatus) | TON Testnet |

### 1.6 Prepare validator user

Prepare and log in a user for the validator

1. Create non-root user

```bash
# Create a non-root validator user
sudo adduser <USERNAME>
sudo usermod -aG sudo <USERNAME>
```

2. Switch to it with reconnecting to server via ssh

```bash reconnect as the new user
exit
ssh <USERNAME>@<SERVER_IP>
```

## Step 2: Validator node installation

### 2.1 Download MyTonCtrl

Run:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-4.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-4.png"
  alt="Downloading MyTonCtrl"
/>

### 2.2 Run validator installation

Run validator installation, installation takes approximately 20 minutes:

```shell install for Mainnet
sudo bash install.sh -m single-nominator -n mainnet
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-5.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-5.png"
  alt="Expected final output for validator installation"
/>

<Accordion
  title="Install validator for Testnet"
>
  ```shell install for Testnet
  sudo bash install.sh -m single-nominator -n testnet
  ```
</Accordion>

### 2.3 Verify status results

Launch MyTonCtrl with command `mytonctrl`. Then, check synchronization status using the command:

```sh
mytonctrl
MyTonCtrl> status
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-2.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-2.png"
  alt="MyTonCtrl status results"
/>

<Aside type="tip">
  Initially you will see _Local validator initial sync status: downloading blockchain state xxxx_ in status, that means you node started synchronization.
</Aside>

### 2.4 Verify validator's port

Print your `engine.addr` port configuration `config.json` file:

```bash
grep -A5 '"addrs"' -n /var/ton-work/db/config.json | grep '"port"' | head -1
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-26.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-26.png"
  alt="Print validator port"
/>

### 2.5 Check validator's port

Make sure UDP `engine.addr` port allowed with following command:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-25.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-25.png"
  alt="Check allowed ports"
/>

If you find out port filtered (absent in allowed), open this port:

```bash
sudo ufw allow <PORT_NUMBER>/udp
```

Then make sure with `sudo ufw status`.

### 2.6 Verify node synchronization

Wait until the node is fully synchronized approximately 3 hours (depends on network connection). Check the field `Local validator initial sync status: x`, the value x should become less than 20.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-8.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-8.png"
  alt="Verify node synchronization in status"
/>

<Aside type="tip">
  Set up [alert bot](https://old-docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/nodes/maintenance-guidelines/mytonctrl-private-alerting) to receive a notification when the node is synchronized.
</Aside>

## Step 3: Configure validator

When installing, MyTonCtrl automatically creates a validator wallet for you. You need to top up and activate (deploy) this wallet so MyTonCtrl can operate Single nominator pool smart contract with it.

### 3.1 Get validator wallet address

```sh
MyTonCtrl> wl
```

You should see a wallet named `validator_wallet_001` and its address.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-7.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-7.png"
  alt="Print validator wallet list"
/>

### 3.2 Back-up validator wallet secret key

Make back-up of your validator wallet secret key:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> ew validator_wallet_001
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-11.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-11.png"
  alt="Back-up validator wallet"
/>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can import this secret key with [`iw`](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/wallet#iw) command.
</Aside>

### 3.3 Explore validator wallet

Explore validator wallet by address with [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/):

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-6.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-6.png"
  alt="Explore validator wallet"
/>

### 3.4 Credit validator wallet

Credit validator wallet. Ensure you have at least 200 TON/month in your validator wallet for operation fees.

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-9.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-9.png"
  alt="Credit validator wallet"
/>

### 3.5 Activate the wallet

Activate (deploy on-chain) validator wallet, run:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> aw validator_wallet_001
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-12.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-12.png"
  alt="Activate validator wallet command result"
/>

That also reflect in Tonviewer, status will displayed as Active

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-14.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-14.png"
  alt="Validator wallet in explorer"
/>

### 3.6 Create a pool

Create a [single nominator pool](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/single-nominator-pool) for secure stake management. As an `owner-address`, specify the beneficiary wallet address that will stake owned funds and receive rewards.

<Aside
  type="danger"
>
  We strongly recommend use cold wallet (Ledger) for an owner and and securely keep that's seed phrase to keep funds safe. In case access to owner wallet lost, there's no way to restore funds.
</Aside>

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner-address>
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-15.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-15.png"
  alt="Create a single pool"
/>

<Accordion
  title="If you’ve already created a pool..."
>
  If you've already created a single nominator pool, you can import it:

  ```bash
  MyTonCtrl> import_pool <pool-name> <pool-addr>
  ```
</Accordion>

### 3.7 Print pool list

Explore pool addresses using `pools_list` command:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-16.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-16.png"
  alt="Pool list result"
/>

At the moment your pool didn't deployed yet, and explorer will display this as `Nonexist` status:

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-17.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-17.png"
  alt="Nonexist pool"
/>

### 3.8 Activate pool

Activate the single pool nominator contract:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-18.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-18.png"
  alt="Activate the pool result"
/>

### 3.9 Verify activated pool

Make sure pool become activated with `pools_list`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
```

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-19.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-19.png"
  alt="Pool list"
/>

Blockchain explorer also should display now deployed contract with `Active` status

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-20.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-20.png"
  alt="Find pool in explorer"
/>

### 3.10 Test deposit to pool

Test deposit to stake workflow. Any user able to make deposit from any address with direct transfer.
Credit decent sum around 10 TON:

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-21.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-21.png"
  alt="Test deposit 1"
/>

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-22.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-22.png"
  alt="Test deposit 2"
/>

### 3.11 Test withdrawal from pool

Test withdrawal workflow. Only owner wallet able request withdrawal.
Send withdrawal request, a message with `w` comment from `owner` wallet to single nominator pool address:

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-24.jpg"
  width="280"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-24.jpg"
  alt="Send withdrawal request"
/>

<Accordion
  title="Withdraw with script..."
>
  Insert your address to `SINGLE_NOMINATOR_ADDRESS` and send this message from the owner's wallet.

  ```js
  import {
    Address,
    beginCell,
    internal,
    storeMessageRelaxed,
    toNano,
  } from "@ton/core";

  async function main() {
    const single_nominator_address = Address.parse("SINGLE_NOMINATOR_ADDRESS");
    const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000;
    const amount = 50000;

    const messageBody = beginCell()
      .storeUint(WITHDRAW_OP, 32)
      .storeUint(0, 64)
      .storeCoins(amount)
      .endCell();

    const internalMessage = internal({
      to: single_nominator_address,
      value: toNano("1"),
      bounce: true,
      body: messageBody,
    });
  }

  ```
</Accordion>

Once you restore your deposit (except 1 TON reserve on single nominator pool) to owner wallet, that means all system set securely and ready for real stake:

<Image
  src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-23.png"
  darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-23.png"
  alt="Pool list"
/>

## Step 4: Set optimal stake for validator

Now you can top up this pool with funds enough for validation. On the next elections MyTonCtrl will automatically use this pool for staking.

<Aside type="tip">
  If the pool's balance is sufficient to participate in both rounds `balance > min_stake_amount * 2`, MyTonCtrl will automatically participate in both rounds using `stake = balance / 2`, unless you manually set the stake using the `set stake` command. This behavior differs from using a nominator pool but resembles staking with a validator wallet.
</Aside>

### 4.1 Retrieve stakes for two last cycles

Retrieve `min_stake` and `max_stake` from [Validation API](https://elections.toncenter.com/getValidationCycles?return_participants=false\&offset=0\&limit=2) for two last cycles.

<Accordion
  title="See expected result..."
>
  <Image
    src="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-28.png"
    darkSrc="/resources/images/nodes/run-validator/run-validator-28.png"
    alt="Cycle info API response"
  />
</Accordion>

For, example:

```json
"cycle_id" : 1764052744,
"min_stake": 701812111528562,  // ~ 701 812 TON
"max_stake": 2008570202020000, // ~ 2 008 570 TON
```

```json
"cycle_id" : 1764052744,
"min_stake": 674810775114391,  // ~ 674 811 TON
"max_stake": 2024432325343173, // ~ 2 024 432 TON
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Values retrieved in nanotons, divide this by $10^9$ to get TON units.
</Aside>

### 4.2 Retrieve stakes boundary values

To cover approximate expected stake for odd and even cycles chose max within two `min_stake` and `max_stake`.

For, example:

```bash
// largest within 701 812 TON and 674 811 TON
av_min_stake = 701812
```

```bash
// largest within 2 008 570 TON and 2 024 432 TON
av_max_stake = 2008570
```

### 4.3 Calculate effective stakes

<Aside type="tip">
  _Effective_ stands for winning elections for both odd and even cycles.
</Aside>

Effective stake for two cycles is a value between doubled maximum and minimum average stakes:

$$
av\_min\_stake * 2 <= effective\_stake <= av\_max\_stake * 2
$$

For example:

```bash
max_expected_effective_stake = max_cycle_stake * 2 = 2008570 * 2 = 4017140
min_expected_effective_stake = min_cycle_stake * 2 = 701812 * 2 = 1403624
```

Then, effective stake approximately within:

$$
1403624\ TON <= effective\_stake <= 4017140\ TON
$$

### 4.4 Deposit effective stake

Deposit directly to single nominator pool address effective stake.

### 4.5 Track first cycle progress

Next election cycle (odd/even), MyTonCtrl will send half of stake from single nominator pool. Track this with browser.

### 4.6 Track second cycle progress

Next paired election cycle (even/odd), MyTonCtrl will send the second half of stake from single nominator pool. Track this with browser.

### 4.7 Verify entire staking cycle

Reward for odd validation cycle will return to single nominator pool united with stake. Verify this with blockchain explorer. In few minutes after reward accepted, MyTonCtrl init re-stake this stake including reward.

  alt="One cycle staking history"
/>

#### Legend

1. Stake for odd cycle.
1. Reward for odd cycle.
1. Reinvestment of the odd cycle stake including reward in the next odd cycle.

### 4.7 Switch to daily maintaining

Make sure you pair stakes circulated properly, then focus on monitor validator health and updates.

## Step 5: Maintain validator

### 5.1 Follow TON announcements channel

Make sure you followed [@tonstatus](https://t.me/tonstatus), turn on notifications, and be prepared for urgent updates if needed.

### 5.2 Organize validator backup

Create validator backup. Learn about [backups](https://old-docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/nodes/maintenance-guidelines/mytonctrl-backup-restore).

### 5.3 Set up alerting

Set up alerting in MyTonCtrl to notify you of critical issues with your validator. For more information, see [MyTonCtrl private alerting bot](https://old-docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/nodes/maintenance-guidelines/mytonctrl-private-alerting) or (and) check [MyTonCtrl public alerting bot](https://t.me/validators).

### 5.4 Set up monitoring

Set up monitoring dashboards for RAM, disk, network, CPU usage and other metrics. See also [MyTonCtrl prometheus export](https://old-docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/nodes/maintenance-guidelines/mytonctrl-prometheus). For technical assistance, please contact [@mytonctrl\_help\_bot](https://t.me/mytonctrl_help_bot).

### 5.5 Monitor the efficiency

Set up dashboards to monitor your validators using the APIs provided below.

1. Track penalized validators on each round with [@tonstatus\_notifications](https://t.me/tonstatus_notifications).
1. Use [Validation API](https://elections.toncenter.com/docs) to obtain information about current and past validation rounds (cycles) - including the timing of rounds, which validators participated, their stakes, and more. Information regarding current and past elections for each validation round is also available.
1. Use this [API](https://toncenter.com/api/qos/index.html#/) to obtain information about the efficiency of validators over time.

<Aside type="tip">
  This API analyzes data from the catchain to provide an estimate of a validator's efficiency. It serves as an alternative to the `checkloadall` utility.
  Unlike `checkloadall`, which only works on validation rounds, this API allows you to set any time interval to analyze a validator's efficiency.
</Aside>

#### Workflow

1. To the API, provide the ADNL address of your validator along with a time interval (`from_ts`, `to_ts`). For accurate results, choose a sufficient interval, such as 18 hours ago to the present moment.
1. Retrieve the result. If your efficiency percentage is below 80%, your validator is malfunctioning.
1. Your validator must actively participate in validation and use the same ADNL address throughout the specified time period. For example, if a validator contributes to validation every second round, you should only indicate the intervals during which they participated. Failing to do so may result in an inaccurate underestimate. This requirement applies not only to masterchain validators (with an index \< 100) but also to other validators (with an index > 100).

### 5.6 Learn slashing policy

If a validator processes less than 90% of the expected blocks during a validation round, they will be fined by 101 TON.

Learn more about the [slashing policy](https://old-docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/nodes/validation/staking-incentives#decentralized-system-of-penalties).

### 5.7 Maintain validator

Stay vigilant on updates, monitor health status and efficiency stability with dashboards.
