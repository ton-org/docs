A blockchain full node is software that stores the current state of the [shardchains](/foundations/shards) defined in the node's configuration locally on the host machine.

Full nodes keep only the most recent data and automatically prune outdated data to optimize storage usage.
They stay synchronized with other full nodes to maintain a consistent copy of the state across the network.

A full node can operate in two network modes:
- [Liteserver](/ecosystem/node/overview#liteserver), which can also act as an [archive liteserver](/ecosystem/node/overview#archive-liteserver).
- [Validator](/ecosystem/node/overview#validator), which can also act as a collator.

Full nodes are managed through the [MyTonCtrl](/ecosystem/node/mytonctrl/overview) tool, which provides additional node management modes.

## MyTonCtrl management modes

|                               Mode                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|         [Liteserver](/ecosystem/node/overview#liteserver)         | In this mode, node keeps the latest shardchain state and serves it to lite clients — external services that request blockchain data. For example, it provides up-to-date blockchain data for wallets.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Archive liteserver](/ecosystem/node/overview#archive-liteserver) | In this mode, node stores all blockchain data, including old blocks and states. For example, it serves explorers with historical data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|          [Validator](/ecosystem/node/overview#validator)          | In this mode, node signs blocks, participates in elections, and earns rewards. For example, it is used to run validation with your stake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|           [Collator](/ecosystem/node/overview#collator)           | In this mode, node produces blocks for validators. It reduces load on the validators by setting up block creation on a separate host machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|     [Nominator pool](/ecosystem/node/overview#nominator-pool)     | In this mode, the smart contract accepts stakes from multiple users and operates a validator on their behalf, distributing rewards securely among participants.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|    [Single nominator](/ecosystem/node/overview#liquid-staking)    | In this mode, the smart contract accepts stakes from a single user and operates a validator on the user’s behalf, distributing rewards securely using a cold wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|     [Liquid staking](/ecosystem/node/overview#liquid-staking)     |  In this mode, the smart contract issues a liquid staking token. Users delegate funds for validation, and staking rewards increase the token’s value.                                                                                                                                                                                  |


### Liteserver

### Archive liteserver

Archive nodes are full nodes that do not prune the blockchain state, which increases storage requirements. It requires 12 TB of disk space.

### Validator

Validator nodes or validators are the TON network participants who propose new blocks and verify transactions according to TON's [_proof-of-stake_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) mechanism. The top 400 validators are selected based on network [configuration parameter](/foundations/config#param-16%3A-validators-limits). Validators receive rewards for validation.


### Collator

### Nominator pool

### Single nominator pool

### Liquid staking

## When to run your own node

- **Use public endpoints when:**
  - building prototypes or light integrations.

<Aside type={"note"}>
 Liteservers and APIs, such as [TON Center](/ecosystem/rpc/toncenter/overview) or other [RPC providers](/ecosystem/rpc/overview), offer read access to blockchain data and support transaction submission to the network.
</Aside>

- **Run your own full node when:**
  - running a validator or staking service.
  - guaranteed uptime or high-volume access beyond third-party limits is required.
