title: "Agent skill"

## Objective

Install the `ton-blockchain` agent Skill so your AI coding agent follows a docs-first workflow when you work on TON-related tasks.

## About Agent Skills

Agent Skills are an open format for packaging instructions, scripts, and resources that skills-compatible agents can discover and apply.

See https://agentskills.io/home for an overview and links to the specification.

## Prerequisites

- The agent you use supports “Skills” (a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter)

## Install in Codex

Run this in Codex:

```
$skill-installer --url https://github.com/ton-org/docs/tree/main/skills/ton-blockchain
```

Then restart Codex to pick up the new skill.

## Install in Claude Code

This installs it as a personal Skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/ton-blockchain && \
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-org/docs/main/skills/ton-blockchain/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/ton-blockchain/SKILL.md
```

Then restart Claude Code to pick up the new skill.

## Install in other agents

Copy `skills/ton-blockchain/SKILL.md` into your agent’s supported Skill directory (for example a project Skill folder), keeping the directory name `ton-blockchain`.
