TON Storage is TON's torrent-like distributed file storage layer. It lets services and users publish **bags of files** and retrieve them over [ADNL and RLDP](/foundations/whitepapers/ton#3-1-abstract-datagram-network-layer) with verifiable [Merkle proofs](/foundations/serialization/merkle). Bags stay off-chain; Merkle proofs let storage flows pair with smart contracts, such as storage providers, when enforceable on-chain terms are needed.

## What TON Storage delivers

- Distribute large files without placing data on-chain
- Prove that a storage provider still holds a bag through on-chain proofs
- Attach bags to TON DNS domains for human-readable access and TON Sites
- Run private or public providers that charge for storage

## Core pieces

- **Bag of files**: a torrent-like package. Its Merkle root (the **bag ID**) uniquely identifies the bag. The meta file (`.bag` equivalent) contains torrent info and header data.
- **storage-daemon** and **storage-daemon-cli**: download, seed, and manage bags. The CLI controls a running daemon.
- **Storage provider contracts**: smart contracts that accept paid storage requests, manage balances, and verify proofs.
- **Networking**: data travels over ADNL using RLDP. Each bag uses its own overlay network, and peers are discovered through TON DHT.

<Aside type="note">
  TON Storage reuses torrent-style terms (torrent, bag, pieces) but transports data over ADNL/RLDP instead of BitTorrent.

## When to use TON Storage

- Host static TON Sites directly from TON Storage
- Distribute application assets, media, or snapshots with verifiable integrity
- Operate a paid storage service with proof-of-storage guarantees
