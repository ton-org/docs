`storage-daemon` downloads and shares TON Storage bags. `storage-daemon-cli` is the console client used to control it.

## Prerequisites

- Linux, macOS, or Windows host with at least a dual-core 1 GHz CPU, 2 GB RAM, 2 GB SSD (plus space for bags), and stable 10 Mb/s bandwidth with a public/static IP
- Global network config file, for example `global.config.json` from the [TON configs](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/)

## Install storage-daemon

- Download prebuilt `storage-daemon` and `storage-daemon-cli` binaries from [TON auto builds](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) (built from the `testnet` branch).
- Or build from source in the [`ton-blockchain/ton`](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/testnet) repository (target: `storage-daemon` and `storage-daemon-cli`).

## Start the daemon

Run the daemon with explicit ports and a data directory:

```bash
storage-daemon -v 3 -C global.config.json -I <IP>:3333 -p 5555 -D storage-db
```

- `-v` — log verbosity (`3` = INFO)
- `-C` — path to the global network config
- `-I` — ADNL IP and port
- `-p` — TCP port for the console interface
- `-D` — path to the daemon database; CLI keys are generated inside `<db>/cli-keys/` on first start

<Aside type="tip">
  Open the console port in your firewall only when needed. Keep it bound to `localhost` if the CLI runs on the same host.
</Aside>

## Connect with storage-daemon-cli

Point the CLI at the console port and keypair generated by the daemon:

```bash
storage-daemon-cli -I 127.0.0.1:5555 -k storage-db/cli-keys/client -p storage-db/cli-keys/server.pub
```

- `-I` — daemon host and console port
- `-k` — client private key path
- `-p` — server public key path (CLI option, not a port)

`storage-daemon-cli` can also run non-interactively:

```bash
storage-daemon-cli ... -c "add-by-meta bag-meta.bag" -c "list --hashes"
```

## Add bags for download

Download by bag ID hash or by meta file:

```bash
add-by-hash <BAG_ID> -d <download-dir>
add-by-meta <meta-file> -d <download-dir>
```

- `BAG_ID` — 64-character hex bag ID
- If `-d` is omitted, files are saved to the daemon's default storage directory.

`list` shows added bags; `list --hashes` prints full IDs. Use either the numeric ordinal from `list` (valid only for the current session) or the full ID in other commands.

### Inspect and control transfers

- `get <BAG_ID>` — show description, size, speed, and file list
- `get-peers <BAG_ID>` — list connected peers
- `download-pause <BAG_ID>` / `download-resume <BAG_ID>` — control downloads
- `upload-pause <BAG_ID>` / `upload-resume <BAG_ID>` — control uploads
- `remove <BAG_ID>` — remove the bag
- `remove --remove-files <BAG_ID>` — remove the bag and files (files are always removed if stored in the daemon's internal directory)

## Partial downloads and priorities

Download only selected files by setting priorities:

```bash
add-by-hash <BAG_ID> -d <download-dir> --partial file1 file2
add-by-meta <meta-file> -d <download-dir> --partial file1 file2
```

Each file has a priority `0–255`; `0` disables download. `--partial` sets listed files to `1` and all others to `0`.

Update priorities after adding the bag:

- `priority-all <BAG_ID> <priority>` — set the same priority for every file
- `priority-idx <BAG_ID> <index> <priority>` — set by file index from `get`
- `priority-name <BAG_ID> <name> <priority>` — set by file name

Priorities can be set before the full file list loads.

## Create and share a bag

Create a bag from a file or directory and start seeding:

```bash
create <path> -d "Description of the bag"
```

Options:

- `--no-upload` — create the bag without uploading; enable later with `upload-resume`
- `--copy` — copy files into the daemon's internal directory before seeding

After creation the CLI prints the bag ID. Share the meta file if others need a `.torrent`-like descriptor:

```bash
get-meta <BAG_ID> <meta-file>
```
