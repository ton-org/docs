Tether USD (USDT) is a stablecoin that represents US dollars. Each USDT is designed to be worth \$1. On TON blockchain, USDT is represented as [Jetton tokens](/standard/tokens/jettons/overview).

Like all jettons, USDT has a Jetton Master contract that identifies the token.

<Aside

  The authentic USDT [Jetton Master](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-it-works#jetton-master) address is:

  `EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs`

  **Any token with a different Jetton Master address is NOT the real USDT.** Always verify this address before accepting or purchasing USDT. Scammers can create fake tokens with similar names.
</Aside>

You can view the official USDT Jetton Master contract on [TON Viewer](https://tonviewer.com/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs).

## How jettons work

While toncoin is handled natively by TON blockchain, Jetton is built on top of it as a set of contracts.

- _Jetton master_: The main [account](/foundations/addresses/overview) that contains metadata and tracks total supply.
- _Jetton wallets_: Each user has their own Jetton wallet account that holds their balance.

When you "have USDT," you actually have a personal USDT Jetton wallet account associated with your regular TON wallet account.

## How to find your USDT Jetton wallet address

Your USDT Jetton wallet address is different from your main TON wallet address. To find it:

### Using TON Viewer

1. Go to [TON Viewer](https://tonviewer.com/).
1. Enter your TON wallet address.
1. Click on the "Tokens" tab.
1. Find "Tether USD" in the list. Beware of scams!
1. Clicking on USDT will show all operations with USDT on your wallet.
1. On the top of the page, you will see your individual USDT wallet address and the amount of USDT you have.

### Programmatically

You can call the `get_wallet_address` method on the USDT Jetton Master account:

```typescript
import { Address, beginCell } from "@ton/core";
import { TonClient } from "@ton/ton";

const myWalletAddress = Address.parse('YOUR_TON_WALLET_ADDRESS');

const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
});

const USDT_MASTER = Address.parse('EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs');

// Call get_wallet_address on the master contract
const result = await client.runMethod(
    USDT_MASTER,
    'get_wallet_address',
    [{
        type: 'slice',
        cell: beginCell()
            .storeAddress(myWalletAddress)
            .endCell(),
    }],
);

const myUsdtWalletAddress = result.stack.readAddress();
console.log('My USDT wallet:', myUsdtWalletAddress.toString());
```

## How to send USDT

Sending USDT requires you to interact with your personal USDT Jetton wallet. Here's how:

### Prerequisites

Before sending USDT, make sure you have:

1. Some USDT balance in your wallet.
1. Some toncoin (approximately 0.1 TON) to pay for transaction fees. In practice, commission will be lower than 0.1 TON, excesses will be returned.
1. The recipient's TON wallet address.

### Using a wallet app

The easiest way to send USDT is through a [wallet app](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/overview). We'll use Tonkeeper for the example.

1. Open your wallet app.
1. Go to your USDT balance.
1. Tap "Send" or "Transfer".
1. Enter the recipient's address.
1. Enter the amount of USDT to send.
1. Optionally add a comment/memo.
1. Confirm and sign the transaction.

### Programmatic transfer

If you're building an application, you need to send a special message to your Jetton wallet. To do this, you need to:

- [Find your USDT jetton wallet address](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-find)
- [Create the correct transfer message](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-transfer)
- Attach sufficient TON for fees

<Aside type="tip">
  If you want to suggest users to transfer USDT through your dApp, you can use the [TON Connect](/ecosystem/ton-connect) library. TON Connect will make user's chosen wallet to ask user to confirm the USDT transfer.
</Aside>

### Important notes about sending programmatically

- _Amount format_: USDT uses 6 decimals. To send 1 USDT, use `1000000` (in elementary units).
- _Gas fees_: Always attach enough TON (\~0.1 TON) to cover fees.
- _Forward amount_: You should always set `forward_amount` to a positive number. This amount will be credited to the recipient's TON wallet along with the USDT. If you don't want to send any TONs along with USDT, set `forward_amount` to `1`, meaning 1 nanoton (0.000000001 TON).
- _Comments_: You can add a text comment that will be visible to the recipient.

## How to receive USDT

To receive USDT, share TON wallet address. However, programmatically processing incoming USDT payments is more complex than it appears.

For businesses, exchanges, or other services that need to programmatically detect and process incoming USDT payments, refer to the [payment processing guide](/ecosystem/processing/overview).

### Why is receiving complex?

When someone sends you USDT:

1. They send a message to **their** USDT jetton wallet.
1. Then their jetton wallet sends a message to **your** USDT jetton wallet.
1. Your jetton wallet may also send a notification message.

This multi-step process requires:

- Monitoring the correct jetton wallet address.
- Understanding the message chain.
- Parsing jetton transfer notifications.
- Handling edge cases (first-time receives, insufficient gas, etc.)

## USDT in Testnet

There is no USDT in Testnet. However, you can create your own test Jetton for development and testing purposes. Use [this web tool](https://minter.ton.org/?testnet=true#) or follow the [guide](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-mint) on how to do it programmatically.
