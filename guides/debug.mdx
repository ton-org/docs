# Debugging smart contracts

It's a common situation when you encounter an error in your smart contract. In some cases, you will see that an unexpected exit code is returned. This can be a sign of a bug in your contract. There are several techniques to debug your contract.

## Log to the console

A straightforward and effective technique. The most common values to print are transactions and get‑method results.

There are helper functions that let you inspect transactions in a developer‑friendly way.

```ts TypeScript
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { Blockchain } from '@ton/sandbox';
import '@ton/test-utils';
import { Test } from './output/sample_Test';
import { findTransaction, flattenTransaction } from '@ton/test-utils';

const setup = async () => {
    const blockchain = await Blockchain.create();
    const owner = await blockchain.treasury('deployer');
    const contract = blockchain.openContract(await Test.fromInit());
    const deployResult = await contract.send(owner.getSender(), { value: toNano(0.5), bounce: true }, null);

    return { blockchain, owner, contract, deployResult };
};

it('should deploy correctly', async () => {
    const { contract, deployResult } = await setup();

    const txToInspect = findTransaction(deployResult.transactions, {
        to: contract.address,
        deploy: true,
    });
    if (txToInspect == undefined) {
        throw new Error('Requested tx was not found.');
    }
    // User-friendly output
    console.log(flattenTransaction(txToInspect));
    // Verbose output
    console.log(txToInspect);
});
```

## Dump values from a contract

Three TVM debug [instructions](/tvm/instructions#fe-debug) exist:

Availability depends on the language you use.

- In Tolk, use functions from the globally available `debug` object.
- In FunC, these methods are available globally in `stdlib.fc`.
- In Tact, use `dumpStack` for `DUMPSTK` and [dump function](https://docs.tact-lang.org/ref/core-debug/#dump) for the other two. Tact also prints the exact line where `dump` is called, so you can quickly find it in your code.

  Debug instructions consume gas and change measured gas usage. Remove them before deploying and compare gas without debug calls.

## Explore TVM logs

```ts TypeScript
const blockchain = await Blockchain.create();
blockchain.verbosity.vmLogs = "vm_logs";
```

There are multiple verbosity levels; two are most useful:

- `vm_logs` — outputs VM logs for each transaction; includes executed instructions and occurred exceptions.
- `vm_logs_full` — outputs full VM logs for each transaction; includes executed instructions with binary offsets, the current stack for each instruction, and gas used by each instruction.

Typical output for `vm_logs` looks like this:

```text
...
execute SWAP
execute PUSHCONT x30
execute IFJMP
execute LDU 64
handling exception code 9: cell underflow
default exception handler, terminating vm with exit code 9
```

The contract tries to load a 64‑bit integer (`LDU 64`) from the slice, but there is not enough data, so [exit code 9](/tvm/exit-codes#9%3A-cell-underflow) occurs.

Inspect the same code with the `vm_logs_full` verbosity level. (Output is heavily truncated from the top)

```text
...
execute PUSHCONT x30
gas remaining: 999018
stack: [ 500000000 CS{Cell{02b168008d0d4580cd8f09522be7c0390a7a632bda4a99291c435b767c95367ebe78e9af0023d36bc5f97853f4c898f868f95b035ae8f555a321d0ffce8d9f6165e2252d7a9077359400060e9fc800000000003d0902d1b85b3919} bits: 711..711; refs: 2..2} 0 Cont{vmc_std} ]
code cell hash: F9EAC82B7999AEEF696D592FE2469B9069FB05ED35C92213D7EE516F45AB97CA offset: 344
execute IFJMP
gas remaining: 999000
stack: [ 500000000 CS{Cell{02b168008d0d4580cd8f09522be7c0390a7a632bda4a99291c435b767c95367ebe78e9af0023d36bc5f97853f4c898f868f95b035ae8f555a321d0ffce8d9f6165e2252d7a9077359400060e9fc800000000003d0902d1b85b3919} bits: 711..725; refs: 2..2} ]
code cell hash: F9EAC82B7999AEEF696D592FE2469B9069FB05ED35C92213D7EE516F45AB97CA offset: 352
execute LDU 64
handling exception code 9: cell underflow
default exception handler, terminating vm with exit code 9
```

<Aside type="tip">
  If you want to dive deep into the error, you can search the TVM source code for the `LDU` instruction. Note that some instructions in TVM are implemented as instruction groups. For example, [LDU](/tvm/instructions#d3-ldu) (`load_uint`), [LDI](/tvm/instructions#d2-ldi) (`load_int`), it's preload versions `(`preload\_uint`and`preload\_int\`).
</Aside>

Stack is printed as `[bottom, ..., top]`, where `top` is the top of the stack.

Here, the stack contains two values:

- Slice being read
- Integer (`500000000`)

However, the slice has only **725** bits, and **711** bits were already read, as were both references. The contract tried to read **64** bits, but there was not enough data in the slice.

You should locate the `load_uint(64)` call that causes the issue and ensure enough bits are available or adjust the read width.

## Explore the transaction tree

For simple transaction trees, print all transactions and inspect them.

```ts TypeScript
const deployRes = await contract.send(owner.getSender(), { value: toNano(0.5), bounce: true }, null);
for (const tx of deployRes.transactions) {
    console.log(flattenTransaction(tx));
}
```

For complex trees, use a GUI tool.

Two tools are commonly used:

- [TonDevWallet trace view](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/dev) — requires the TonDevWallet application; does not require a custom `@ton/sandbox`; requires the `@tondevwallet/traces` package.
- [TxTracer Sandbox](https://txtracer.ton.org/sandbox/) — requires a custom `@ton/sandbox` package; runs in your browser.

Also, these tools allow you to explore each transaction's separate logs.
