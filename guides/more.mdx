## Interactive learning

### Code playgrounds

- [TxTracer](https://txtracer.ton.org/) - Trace and analyze TON Blockchain transactions with tools to visualize execution, inspect and debug smart contracts with a code editor and user-friendly interface.
- [Assembly Playground](https://txtracer.ton.org/play/) - Experiment with TVM assembly code directly in your browser. Write, test, and debug assembly instructions with real-time execution.
- [Code Explorer](https://txtracer.ton.org/code-explorer/) - Compile FunC or Tolk code to assembly and explore the generated bytecode to understand how your smart contracts work under the hood.
- [TVM Instruction table](https://txtracer.ton.org/spec/) - Browse the TVM instruction reference with detailed descriptions, opcodes, stack effects, and control flow information for every instruction.
- [Sandbox](https://txtracer.ton.org/sandbox/) - Inspect transactions produced by your local tests using the `@ton/sandbox` package. Visualize messages, transaction info, VM logs and exit codes with an interactive UI.

### Challenges and exercises

- [Hack the TON](https://www.hacktheton.com/en) - TON-based wargame inspired by The Ethernaut, played in the TON Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be hacked. Our goal is to help you to learn how to develop safe TON smart contracts and build a thriving community around this craft.

## Smart contract examples

Examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validator elections on TON), multi-signature wallets, and many more. They can serve as an excellent reference for those studying on real projects.

- [Tolk benchmark contracts](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench) - Tolk vs. FunC gas benchmarks and, simultaneously, reference Tolk contracts.
