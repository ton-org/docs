This guide keeps only the fundamentals: how to structure pages, how to write examples, and how to keep things consistent and safe.

## Write with the reader in mind

* Be answer‑first. Start with what the reader will achieve, what they need, and the steps. This shortens time to success.
* Lead with a working example. Show a copy‑pasteable snippet early and the expected output. This proves the path works.
* Use a neutral, precise tone. Write in present tense, active voice, and second person (“Run the node”). This makes actions unambiguous.
* Keep it scannable. Use short sections and paragraphs, clear headings, lists, and tables. Most readers skim to find the next action.
* Assume developers new to blockchain. Do not re‑teach generic skills unless a TON‑specific nuance requires it. This keeps pages focused.

## Page types

* Step by step — for beginners; handhold from zero to first success on one happy path; explain from scratch, define terms, and link out for depth.
* How‑to — a focused recipe for a specific outcome; assume concepts known and show only what’s needed.
* Explanation — concepts, architecture, and trade‑offs; clarify why and when, with minimal examples.
* Reference — exact, complete facts (APIs, CLI, types, errors); stable anchors and minimal prose.
* Don’t mix types on the same page.

## Place pages in the docs structure

* Keep the flow linear; follow the `docs.json` sidebar.
* In each topic group, order pages: Explanation → How‑to → Reference. Use `overview.mdx` as the Explanation when present.
* Canonical specs — `reference/`. Link to it; don’t duplicate tables or parameters.

## Structure pages for fast success

* Open with Objective and Prerequisites. This lets readers confirm they are in the right place.
* Present Steps as single actions. Use sub‑bullets for options. This reduces ambiguity.
* Include Verify and Troubleshoot. Readers can confirm success and recover from common errors.
* End with Next steps / See also only if essential (1–3 links). Prefer a linear path that needs no extra navigation.

## Write examples that run

* Make commands copy‑pasteable. Do not include shell prompts like `$` or `>`. Prompts break commands when pasted.
* Separate command and output. Use two fenced blocks. Mixing them causes copy errors.
* Use `<ANGLE_CASE>` placeholders in commands and prose and define each on first use (for example, `<RPC_URL>`). In code, use `UPPER_SNAKE` if `< >` would clash with syntax. One visible convention prevents hard‑coded values from slipping in.
* Tag code fences with a language (`bash`, `json`, `rust`, and so on). This enables correct highlighting and tooling.
* Prefer end‑to‑end examples on testnet by default. Safer defaults invite readers to try the steps.
* Label partial snippets as Not runnable and link to a full example. This sets expectations and gives a path to success.
* Do not hard‑wrap long commands. Use soft wrap in the UI or safe continuation if the shell supports it. Hard wraps break execution.

Good

```bash
ton-node start --ledger <LEDGER_DIR> --network testnet
```

Expected output

```text
Node started. Workchain: 0  Shard: -1  Status: running
```

Define placeholders
`<LEDGER_DIR>` — local ledger directory.
`<RPC_URL>` — HTTPS endpoint of your TON RPC provider.

## Show safety clearly

Add a Caution or Warning when a step moves funds, changes fees or withdrawals, exposes or stores private keys or mnemonics, modifies validator or network settings, or performs chain‑affecting operations such as resharding, pruning, halting, or replay. These actions can cause irreversible loss or outages.

Pattern

> Warning — funds at risk
> Running the next command on mainnet transfers funds irreversibly.
> Safer first (testnet):
>
> ```bash
> jetton transfer --to <ADDR> --amount <AMOUNT> --network testnet
> ```
>
> If you must use mainnet: no rollback; on‑chain transfers are final.

Default to testnet in task pages. Make destructive flags opt‑in and document mitigations.

## Titles, headings, navigation

* Use sentence case, keep headings concise and unique. Clean labels scan better and avoid duplicate anchors.
* Tasks use imperatives (“Deploy a validator”); concepts use nouns (“Validator architecture”). Titles should signal action versus explanation.
* Do not style headings, except when a reference identifier needs code font. Extra styling clutters the table of contents.
* Use clear section labels such as Verify, Troubleshoot, and See also. Readers recognize these patterns and find what they need faster.

## Link to details, do not duplicate them

* On first useful mention, link flags, parameters, error codes, and data types to their reference anchors. This delivers exact details when needed.
* Do not paste reference tables into guides. Link instead. Duplicated tables go stale.
* Use descriptive link text, not “click here”. This helps scanning and accessibility.
* Link core TON terms to the Glossary on first useful mention unless you define them on the page. Consistent definitions reduce confusion.
* Prefer stable, relative internal links and precise anchors. Links keep working when the site moves.

## Terminology and names

* Use the project term bank for canonical spellings, casing, and preferred terms. One vocabulary prevents drift.
  Examples: TON, jetton, smart contract, BoC (bag of cells), AccountChain, ShardChain, WorkChain, MasterChain, BaseChain.
* Prefer allowlist and denylist over whitelist and blacklist. These are clearer and inclusive.
* Use mainnet and testnet as common nouns. Use TON Mainnet and TON Testnet for the proper names. This distinguishes the generic type from the named network.

## Files, frontmatter, labels

* Filenames use `kebab-case.md` or `kebab-case.mdx` (for example, `validator-setup.mdx`). This is readable and consistent across platforms.
* Start each page with a single H1 that matches the page title. This keeps the table of contents clean and anchors stable.
* Optional frontmatter can declare `doc_type`, `audience`, and `status` (experimental or deprecated). If deprecated, add an Important callout with the replacement and timeline. This sets expectations for readers and reviewers.
* Sidebar labels are short (2–4 words) and mirror in‑page headings. Short labels avoid truncation.

## Accessibility and international readers

* Use plain, international English and avoid idioms and culture‑specific references. Idioms do not translate well.
* Write descriptive headings and link text. Screen readers and skimmers rely on them.
* Tables have headers and units (for example, “Latency (ms)”) and keep cells brief. Structure improves comprehension.
* Provide text alternatives for complex figures when feasible. Visuals should be usable by more readers.

## Secrets, data, environments

* Never include real keys, mnemonics, or tokens. Use placeholders or clearly invalid test values. This prevents accidental leaks.
* Prefer environment variables or keystores over inlining secrets. This reduces exposure in history and logs.
* Call out any command that can delete, rewrite, or lock state. This flags risk before damage.
* Label the environment explicitly when it matters, such as testnet versus mainnet. This avoids running risky steps on the wrong network.

## Quick publish checklist

* Page type chosen and outline followed.
* Objective, prerequisites, steps, verify, and troubleshoot present where applicable.
* Examples copy‑pasteable, tagged, and testnet by default; partials labeled.
* Safety callouts added where funds, keys, or state are at risk.
* Headings concise and sentence case; links point to exact anchors.
* Terms match the term bank; casing and placeholders consistent.
* Tables have headers and units; figures have text alternatives where needed.
