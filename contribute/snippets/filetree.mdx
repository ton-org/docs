import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';

To display the structure of a directory with file icons and collapsible sub-directories, use the `<FileTree>` component. You can open or close a sub-directory by clicking on it.

<Aside>Additionally, you can add notes to files and directories.</Aside>

## Import

```tsx
import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';
```

## Usage

To display the file tree with file icons and collapsible sub-directories using the `<FileTree>` component, specify the structure of your files and directories inside the [`items` property](#items) as a JavaScript list of objects and strings.

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';

<FileTree items={[ /* ...entries, see below... */ ]} />
```

### Specify files and placeholders

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';

{/* Files and a placeholder by the end */}
<FileTree
  items={[
    "file-name-1",
    "file-name-2",
    "file-name-3",
    "...", // will be rendered as a … icon
  ]}
/>
```

<FileTree
  items={[
  "file-name-1",
  "file-name-2",
  "file-name-3",
  "...",
]}
/>

### Add notes and comments

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';

{/* Using objects to add notes or nested folders */}
<FileTree
  items={[
    "file-name-1",
    { kind: "file", name: "file-name-2", note: "very important file" },
    {
      kind: "folder",
      name: "best-folder",
      note: "not really",
      open: false, // otherwise defaults to true
      items: ["file-name-3-within-subfolder"],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

<FileTree
  items={[
  "file-name-1",
  { kind: "file", name: "file-name-2", note: "very important file" },
  {
    kind: "folder",
    name: "best-folder",
    note: "not really",
    open: false,
    items: ["file-name-3-within-subfolder"],
  },
]}
/>

### Specify folders and their state

```mdx
import { FileTree } from '/snippets/filetree.jsx';

{/* Make all sub-folders be closed by default */}
<FileTree
  items={[
    { kind: "folder", name: "folder-1", open: true, items: ["something1"] },
    { kind: "folder", name: "folder-2", items: ["something2"] },
  ]}
  defaultOpen={false} {/* otherwise defaults to true */}
/>
```

<FileTree
  items={[
  { kind: "folder", name: "folder-1", open: true, items: ["something1"] },
  { kind: "folder", name: "folder-2", items: ["something2"] },
]}
  defaultOpen={false}
/>

## `<FileTree>` props

**Implementation:** [`filetree.jsx`](https://github.com/ton-org/docs/blob/main/snippets/filetree.jsx)

The `<FileTree>` component accepts the following props:

### `items` (required)

**type:** `FileTreeItem[]`

Hierarchy of files and folders to display.

The `FileTreeItem` can be one of the following kinds:

- `...` or `…` — both display a placeholder icon `…` indicating that a directory is expected to contain more items without specifying them all explicitly
- any `string` — name of the file inside the currently described directory
- `{ kind: "file", ...fields... }` — an extended syntax for files, with the following fields:
  - `name: string` — the filename
  - `note?: string` — optional comment, which is displayed next to the filename
- `{ kind: "folder", ...fields... }` — syntax for folders and directories, with the following fields:
  - `name: string` — the directory name
  - `note?: string` — optional comment, which is displayed next to the directory name
  - `open?: boolean` — whether to open the directory, defaults to `true`
  - `items: FileTreeItem[]` — nested files and folders

Notice that folders are open by default, i.e., their `open` property is `true` unless specified otherwise.

### `defaultOpen`

**type:** `boolean` <br />
**default:** `true`

Whether to open all folders upon the page load. Can be overridden by the `open` property of the `FileTreeItem` entry.
