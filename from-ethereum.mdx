Learn how to develop and build on TON coming from the Ethereum (EVM) ecosystem.

## Execution model

### Asynchronous blockchain

A fundamental aspect of TON development is the asynchronous execution model. Messages sent by one contract take time to arrive at another, so the resulting transactions for processing incoming messages occur after the current transaction terminates.

Compared to Ethereum, where multiple messages and state changes on different contracts can be processed within the same atomic transaction, a TON transaction represents a state change only for one account and only for a processing of a single message. Even though in both blockchains a signed included-in-block unit is called a "transaction", one transaction on Ethereum usually corresponds to several transactions on TON, that are processed over a span of several blocks.

| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Single message processing with state change on one contract                                    | Message call or "internal transaction" | Transaction                      |
| Number of state changes and messages on different accounts produced from initial contract call | Transaction                            | Chain of transactions or "trace" |

Consider a practical example: liquidity withdrawal on a DEX.

- On Ethereum, it appears as a single atomic transaction with multiple contract calls inside it. This transaction has a single hash and is included in one block.

- The same operation on TON consists of a sequence of more than 10 transactions. Each arrow on this image represents a distinct finalized transaction, with its own hash, inclusion block, and all the other properties:

  />

Executing a large transaction on Ethereum or any other EVM-based blockchain comes with certain limitations: [call depth](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm/#evm-instructions) of 1,024 nested calls and the [block gas limit](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/blocks/#block-size). With TON's asynchronous execution model, a trace — a chain of transactions — can have any length, as long as there are enough fees to continue it. For example, the [trace](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/e887503f7dac857be80487e3ed0774db962379d1c153e6df7b9b5313c657ab94) resulting from this message consisted of more than 1.5 million transactions, lasting more than 4,000 blocks until completion.

### On-chain get methods

Another difference is in the **get methods**. Both Ethereum and TON support them, allowing data to be retrieved from contracts without paying fees. However, in TON, get methods **cannot** be called on-chain — a contract cannot synchronously retrieve data from another contract during a transaction.

To understand how any DeFi protocol or complex on-chain system works with these limitations, read about the on-chain
[Carry-value pattern](/contract-dev/carry-value).

### Account model

In Ethereum, there are two types of accounts: _externally owned accounts_, or EOAs, and _contract accounts_. EOAs are human-controlled entities, each represented by a private-public key pair. They sign transactions and each has its own balance; the community often refers to them as "wallets".

In TON, there is _no such separation_; every valid address represents an on-chain account, each with its own state and balance, that could be changed through transactions. Read more about accounts [here](/foundations/addresses/overview). This means that "wallets" in TON are smart contracts that operate under the same rules as any other contract on the blockchain.

The TON wallet smart contract uses regular asymmetric cryptography to control message signing, ensuring that the user experience remains essentially unchanged. The [wallet standard](/standard/wallets/comparison) implementation code, along with its evolution throughout the ecosystem's development, can be explored.

### Limited contract storage

In Ethereum, it's possible to store any amount of data in a single contract. Unbounded maps and arrays are considered standard practice and are present in most contract examples. This is not the case with TON — every smart contract on the TON blockchain has a storage size upper limit. This means that ERC-20-like fungible tokens cannot be implemented in the same way as in an EVM chain, using a single map within a single contract.

[The limit](/foundations/config) is 65,536 unique cells per message or contract storage. Each cell is up to 1,023 bits, which sets a hard upper limit.

<Aside
  type="danger"
>
  Every map that is expected to grow beyond **1,000** values is dangerous. In the TVM map, key access is asymptotically logarithmic, meaning that gas consumption continuously increases to find keys as the map grows.
</Aside>

Instead, [sharding](/foundations/shards) should be used.

More about the [TON architecture design](/foundations/overview) choices that led to these differences can be found [here](/standard/overview).

## Ecosystem

### Tooling

<Aside>
  This section primarily focuses on Typescript tooling since historically this language has been better adopted and well-established in TON.
</Aside>

The recommended programming language for smart contract development in TON is [Tolk](/languages/tolk). Other established languages are also used in the ecosystem; more information about them is available [here](/languages/tact).

Another library to know about is [`@ton/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core). This library handles low-level blockchain primitives (de)serialization and is typically used together with any RPC client or contract interaction library.

### Services

Web3 developers often rely on specific products and services for on-chain development.

### Standards

The table maps Ethereum standards and proposals, including ERC and EIP, to their TON counterparts, referred to as TEP.

<Aside>
  Due to significant differences in execution models, most of the standards in TON differ significantly in semantics and general approach compared to their Ethereum analogs.
