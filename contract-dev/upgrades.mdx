## What is contract upgrading?

TON allows smart contracts to upgrade their code and data while preserving the contract's identity. 

This is useful for fixing bugs, adding features, or adapting to protocol changes without migrating to a new contract.

Upgrades are critical when other contracts reference the contract being upgraded. For example, NFT items reference their collection contract. The collection admin cannot modify these references stored in existing NFT items. Without upgrades, fixing bugs or adding features would require deploying a new collection and migrating all items—an expensive and complex process. Upgrades solve this by allowing the collection contract to evolve in place while preserving all existing references.

The pattern is also essential for [vanity](/contract-dev/vanity) contracts and protocols like DEXs where preserving the contract address and liquidity is critical.

## How upgrades work

Tolk provides two functions for upgrades.

- _`contract.setCodePostponed(code: cell)`_ — schedules the code to be replaced during the [action phase](/foundations/phases#action-phase). The new code takes effect after the current transaction completes.
- _`contract.setData(data: cell)`_ — immediately replaces the contract's persistent storage. This happens during the [compute phase](/foundations/phases#compute-phase), before the transaction ends.

_Key difference_: `setCodePostponed()` applies changes _after_ the current transaction, while `setData()` applies changes _immediately_. This means the new code won't run until the next message arrives, but the new data is already active.

<Aside

  Contract upgrades change code behavior and can affect funds or contract state. Unauthorized upgrades can cause loss of control or funds. Restrict upgrade messages to trusted admin addresses only. For production contracts, use delayed upgrades to allow users to react to compromised admin keys.
</Aside>

## Basic upgrade pattern

The contract accepts upgrade messages containing new code and data. Only the admin can trigger upgrades.

### How it works

1. _Admin sends upgrade message_ — the message contains new code, data, or both
1. _Contract verifies sender_ — checks that the sender is the admin address
1. _Code is scheduled_ — if new code is provided, `setCodePostponed()` schedules it for replacement
1. _Data is upgraded_ — if new data is provided, `setData()` immediately replaces the storage
1. _Transaction completes_ — the action phase executes, applying the new code
1. _Next message uses new code_ — subsequent messages execute with the upgraded logic

The upgrade happens immediately in a single transaction. The new code becomes active after the transaction completes. Any data replacement happens during the compute phase, so the new data is immediately available when the transaction ends.

### Example

```tolk
struct (0x1111) UpgradeContract {
    data: cell?
    code: cell?
}

type AllowedMessages = UpgradeContract

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {

    val msg = lazy AllowedMessages.fromSlice(in.body);

    match (msg) {

        UpgradeContract => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 1111;
            if (msg.code != null) {
                contract.setCodePostponed(msg.code!);
            }
            if (msg.data != null) {
                contract.setData(msg.data!);
            }
        }

        else => { 
            // just accept TON 
        }
    }
}

struct Storage {
    adminAddress: address
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun Storage.save(self) {
    contract.setData(self.toCell());
}
```

## Delayed upgrades for production safety

When upgrading protocols that are already running and have users, delayed upgrades are a best practice. This provides additional security layers: if an admin is compromised, there is time to react. Users can also see the upgrade and withdraw funds from the protocol if it has been compromised.

The pattern adds a time delay between requesting and approving an upgrade. The admin must first request an upgrade, wait for a timeout period, then approve it.

### How it works

1. _Admin requests upgrade_ — sends `RequestUpgrade` message with new code and data
1. _Contract verifies and stores_ — validates admin, ensures no pending request, stores upgrade details with timestamp
1. _Timeout period_ — the contract enforces a waiting period before approval
1. _Admin approves upgrade_ — sends `ApproveUpgrade` message after timeout expires
1. _Contract verifies timeout_ — checks that enough time has passed since the request
1. _Upgrade applies_ — schedules new code with `setCodePostponed()` and upgrades data with `setData()`
1. _Request cleared_ — removes the pending request from storage

The admin can also send `RejectUpgrade` at any time to cancel a pending upgrade. This three-message flow (request → wait → approve or reject) gives users time to review changes and react if the admin account is compromised.

### Example

```tolk
struct UpgradeContract {
    data: cell?
    code: cell?
}

struct CurrentRequest {
    newUpgrade: UpgradeContract
    timestamp: uint32
}

struct (0x00000001) RequestUpgrade {
    newUpgrade: UpgradeContract
}

struct (0x00000002) RejectUpgrade { }

struct (0x00000003) ApproveUpgrade { }

type AllowedMessages =
    | RequestUpgrade
    | RejectUpgrade
    | ApproveUpgrade

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {

    val msg = lazy AllowedMessages.fromSlice(in.body);

    match (msg) {

        RequestUpgrade => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();

            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 100;
            assert (storage.CurrentRequest == null) throw 101;

            storage.CurrentRequest = {
                newUpgrade: msg.newUpgrade,
                timestamp: blockchain.now()
            };

            storage.save();
        }

        RejectUpgrade => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();

            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 100;
            assert (storage.CurrentRequest != null) throw 201;

            storage.CurrentRequest = null;
            storage.save();
        }

        ApproveUpgrade => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            
            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 100;
            assert (storage.CurrentRequest != null) throw 301;
            assert (storage.CurrentRequest!.timestamp + storage.timeout < blockchain.now()) throw 302;

            if (storage.CurrentRequest!.newUpgrade.code != null) {
                contract.setCodePostponed(storage.CurrentRequest!.newUpgrade.code!);
                storage.CurrentRequest = null;
                storage.save();
            }

            if (storage.CurrentRequest!.newUpgrade.data != null) {
                contract.setData(storage.CurrentRequest!.newUpgrade.data!);
            }
        }

        else => { 
            // just accepted tons 
        }
    }
}

get fun currentRequest() {
    var storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.CurrentRequest;
}

struct Storage {
    adminAddress: address,
    timeout: uint32,
    CurrentRequest: CurrentRequest?
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun Storage.save(self) {
    contract.setData(self.toCell());
}
```

## Hot upgrades for frequently upgraded contracts

Standard upgrade methods fail when a contract receives frequent updates. For example, DEX pools that update prices every second or lending protocols that continuously adjust interest rates. The problem: it is not possible to predict what data will be in storage when the upgrade transaction executes.

When an upgrade message with new code and data is sent, other transactions may execute before the upgrade arrives. By the time the upgrade applies, the prepared data may be stale. For a DEX pool, this can overwrite current price data with outdated values, breaking the protocol.

Hot upgrades solve this by scheduling a code change and immediately calling a migration function with the new code. The migration function runs in the same transaction that applies the upgrade. It reads the old storage structure, transforms it to match the new schema, and writes the upgraded storage. This preserves all state changes that happened between preparing the upgrade and executing it.

### How it works

1. _Admin sends upgrade message_ — the message contains new code cell and optional additional data
1. _Contract verifies sender_ — checks that the sender is the admin address
1. _Schedule code change_ — `setCodePostponed()` schedules the code replacement
1. _Switch to new code_ — `setTvmRegisterC3()` immediately activates the new code in register [C3](/tvm/registers#c3-—-function-selector)
1. _Call migration_ — invoke `hotUpgradeData()` which now runs with the new code
1. _Migration executes_ — the function reads old storage, transforms it, and writes new storage

The key mechanism: `setTvmRegisterC3()` switches the code register so the migration function executes with the new code in the same transaction. The migration reads the current storage state (preserving all updates), transforms it to the new schema, and saves it. When the transaction completes, the new code becomes permanent through `setCodePostponed()`.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  Hot upgrades require careful migration logic. Test migrations thoroughly on testnet. If the migration function fails, the contract becomes unusable. The `hotUpgradeData()` function runs only during upgrade messages, not on regular messages, preventing accidental repeated migrations.
</Aside>

### Example

The example shows a counter contract that adds a metadata field through a hot upgrade. The storage structure changes: the original version stores only `adminAddress` and `counter`. The new version adds `metadata` and reorders fields.

Original contract (`main.tolk`):

```tolk
import "@stdlib/tvm-lowlevel"

struct (0x00001111) HotUpgrade {
    additionalData: cell?
    code: cell
}

struct (0x00002222) IncreaseCounter {}

type AllowedMessages =
    | HotUpgrade
    | IncreaseCounter

// migration function must have method_id 
@method_id(2121)
fun hotUpgradeData(additionalData: cell?) { return null; }

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {

    val msg = lazy AllowedMessages.fromSlice(in.body);

    match (msg) {

        HotUpgrade => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 1111;
            
            contract.setCodePostponed(msg.code);

            setTvmRegisterC3(transformSliceToContinuation(msg.code.beginParse()));
            hotUpgradeData(msg.additionalData);
        } 

        IncreaseCounter => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            storage.counter += 1;
            storage.save();
        }

        else => { 
            // just accept TON 
        }
    }
}

get fun counter() {
    var storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.counter;
}

struct Storage {
    adminAddress: address
    counter: uint32
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun Storage.save(self) {
    contract.setData(self.toCell());
}
```

The `hotUpgradeData()` function in the original code returns `null` because it does not perform any migration. When the upgrade message arrives:

1. `contract.setCodePostponed(msg.code)` schedules the new code
1. `setTvmRegisterC3()` switches register C3 to the new code immediately
1. `hotUpgradeData(msg.additionalData)` is called and runs with the new code

New contract with migration (`new.tolk`):

```tolk
import "@stdlib/tvm-lowlevel"

struct (0x00001111) HotUpgrade {
    additionalData: cell?
    code: cell
}

struct (0x00002222) IncreaseCounter {}

type AllowedMessages =
    | HotUpgrade
    | IncreaseCounter

// migration function must have method_id 
@method_id(2121)
fun hotUpgradeData(additionalData: cell?) {  
    var oldStorage = lazy oldStorage.load();

    assert (additionalData != null) throw 1112;
    
    var storage = Storage {
        adminAddress: oldStorage.adminAddress,
        counter: oldStorage.counter,
        metadata: additionalData!
    };

    contract.setData(storage.toCell());
}

struct oldStorage {
    adminAddress: address
    counter: uint32
}

fun oldStorage.load() {
    return oldStorage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}


fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {

    val msg = lazy AllowedMessages.fromSlice(in.body);

    match (msg) {

        HotUpgrade => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            assert (in.senderAddress == storage.adminAddress) throw 1111;
            
            contract.setCodePostponed(msg.code);

            setTvmRegisterC3(transformSliceToContinuation(msg.code.beginParse()));
            hotUpgradeData(msg.additionalData);
        } 

        IncreaseCounter => {
            var storage = lazy Storage.load();
            storage.counter += 1;
            storage.save();
        }

        else => { 
            // just accept TON 
        }
    }
}

get fun metadata() {
    var storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.metadata;
}

get fun counter() {
    var storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.counter;
}
struct Storage {
    counter: uint32
    adminAddress: address
    metadata: cell
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun Storage.save(self) {
    contract.setData(self.toCell());
}
```

In the new version, `hotUpgradeData()` performs the migration:

1. Loads storage using the old structure (`oldStorage` with `adminAddress` and `counter`)
1. Creates new storage with the additional `metadata` field from `additionalData`
1. Reorders fields (`counter` moves before `adminAddress`)
1. Writes the migrated storage immediately with `contract.setData()`

The migration runs in the same transaction as the upgrade message. Any counter increments that happened between preparing the upgrade and executing it remain in storage because the migration reads the current state, not a pre-prepared snapshot. The migration function explicitly handles the structure change by reading fields from the old layout and writing them in the new layout.

### When to use hot upgrades

Use hot upgrades when:

- The contract receives frequent state updates (DEX pools, oracles, lending protocols)
- Storage changes between preparing and applying the upgrade would cause data loss
- You need to preserve all intermediate state transitions

Use standard upgrades when:

- The contract upgrades infrequently
- You can predict storage state at upgrade time
- Simpler upgrade logic reduces risk

## Combining delayed and hot upgrades

You can combine delayed upgrades with hot upgrades for production protocols that require both safety and structure migration. The delayed pattern provides time for users to review changes, while the hot upgrade mechanism handles storage migration without data loss.
