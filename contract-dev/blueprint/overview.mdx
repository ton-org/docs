For smart contract development on TON Blockchain, **Blueprint** is an all-in-one development environment designed to enhance the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

It includes:

- [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint/blob/develop/README.md) — core tools for building contracts.
- [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox) — fast local testing in an isolated blockchain.
- [Create TON App](https://github.com/ton-org/create-ton) — scaffolding a ready-to-use project.
- [Testing utils](https://github.com/ton-org/test-utils) — testing helpers and unit test matchers.

This section covers development, testing, smart contracts deployment and interaction, performance benchmarks, and blueprint configuration and reference.

## Quick start

To get started immediately, run the following command to create a new project and follow the on-screen instructions:

```console
npm create ton@latest
```

## Key features

- **Project scaffolding** — create a ready-to-use development environment with `npm create ton@latest`.
- **Streamlined workflow** — build, test, and deploy smart contracts efficiently.
- **Simple deployment** — publish contracts to Mainnet and Testnet directly from your wallet.
- **Fast local testing** — run multiple contracts in an isolated in-process blockchain.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 22 or later
- Verify the version with `node -v`

## IDE plugins

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23382-ton)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-core.vscode-ton)

## Environment setup

1. Run and follow the on-screen instructions: `npm create ton@latest`.
1. From the project directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Project structure

- `contracts/` — smart contract source code and imports.
- `scripts/` — deployment scripts for Mainnet and Testnet, as well as scripts for interacting with live contracts.
- `tests/` — TypeScript test suite for all contracts, using [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox) for in-process execution.
- `wrappers/` — TypeScript interface classes for all contracts **except Tact**.
  - Each wrapper implements the `Contract` interface from [@ton/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton/core).
    - Provides message serialization and deserialization, getter wrappers, and compilation helpers.
    - Used in both the test suite and client code to interact with contracts from TypeScript.
- `build/` — compilation artifacts generated by the build command.
