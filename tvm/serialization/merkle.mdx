Merkle proof cells verify that some cell tree data belongs to the full tree. See [Merkel proof cells page](/ton/cells/merkle-proofs) for details. 
This design allows the verifier to avoid storing the entire tree's content while still being able to verify the content using the root hash.

A Merkle proof cell contains exactly one reference `c`. Its level `0 <= l < 3` is `max{Lvl(c) - 1, 0}`.

Each Merkle proof cell serializes as follows:
- one tag byte with value `0x03`;
- the 256-bits first [higher hash](higher-hashes) of the referenced cell `c` or the [representation hash](/tvm/serialization/cells) 
of `c` if its level equals zero;
- 2 bytes that store the depth of the deleted subtree that was replaced by the reference.
