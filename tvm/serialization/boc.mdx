title: "Bag of cells"
---

Arbitrary data are represented in the TON Blockchain by trees of cells. Such a tree of cells is transformed into a
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of cells by identifying identical cells in the
tree. After that, each of the references of each cell might be replaced by the
32-byte [representation hash](/tvm/serialization/cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash) of the cell referred to. Thus a _bag of cells (BoC)_ is obtained.
In general, a BoC can be obtained from several trees of cells, thus forming a forest. By convention, the root of the original tree of 
cells is a marked element of the resulting bag of cells, so that anybody receiving this bag of cells and knowing
the marked element can reconstruct the original DAG of cells, hence also the original tree of cells. 
However, this BoC needs to be serialized into a file, suitable for disk storage or network transfer.

There may be many different ways to serialize such a data structure, each of which has its own goals and is convenient for specific cases.
This page provides a general serialization algorithm and specification of corresponding TL-B schemes, 
followed by the specific implementation used in the TON Blockchain.

## General scheme

### Internal references, absent cells, and complete BoCs

Consider an arbitrary cell `c` in a given BoC. A reference of `c` is called _internal_ if 
the cell corresponding to the reference is also represented in BoC. Otherwise, the reference is called _external_ and the corresponding 
cell is called _absent_ from that BoC. In turn, a BoC is called _complete_ if it does not contain any external references.

Although most real-world cases only deal with complete BoCs, in general, the serialization of absent cells in BoC 
differs from the serialization of included cells. Therefore, it is very important to be able to identify the type of references.

### Assigning indices to the cells from a bag of cells

In the process of BoC serialization, the assignment of indices of its cells plays an important role.
Let `c1, ..., cn` be the `n` distinct cells belonging to a bag of cells B.
The most used options are:
- Order cells by their representation hash. Thus `Hash(ci) < Hash(cj)` whenever `i < j`.
- [Topological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

### Outline of serialization process

The serialization process of a BoC `B` consisting of `n` cells can be outlined as follows.
-  List the cells from B in a chosen order: `c1, ..., cn`(with `c1, ..., c_k` as root cells).
-  Choose an integer number `s`, such that `n ≤ 2^s`. Represent each cell `ci` by an integral number of bytes
as in standard representation cell algorithm, but using unsigned big-endian 
s-bit integer `j` instead of hash `Hash(cj)` to represent internal references to cell `cj`. More precisely, each
individual cell `c` is serialized as follows, provided `s` is a multiple of eight.
    - Two descriptor bytes `d1` and `d2` are computed by
      setting `d1 = r + 8x + 16h + 32l` and $d2 = \lfloor \frac{b}{8} \rfloor + \lceil \frac{b}{8}\rceil$ (for absent cells, 
      only `d1` is present, always equals to `7 + 16 + 32l`), where:
      - `0 ≤ r ≤ 4` is the number of cell references present in cell `c`, if `c` is
        absent from the bag of cells being serialized and is represented by
        its hashes only, then `r` is set to `7`;
      - `0 ≤ b ≤ 1023` is the number of data bits in cell `c`;
      - `0 ≤ l ≤ 3` is the level of cell `c`;
      - `x = 1` for exotic cells and `x = 0` for ordinary cells;
      - `h = 1` if the cell’s hashes are explicitly included into the serialization; otherwise, `h = 0` (when `r = 7`, `h` must be `1`).
    - Two bytes `d1` and `d2` (if `r < 7`) or one byte `d1` (if `r = 7`) begin the serialization of `c`.
    - If `h = 1`, the serialization is continued by `l + 1` 32-byte higher hashes of `c`: $Hash_{1}(c), \ldots, Hash_{l+1}(c) = RepHash(c)$.
    - After that, $\lceil\frac{b}{8}\rceil$ data bytes are serialized, by splitting `b` data bits into 8-bit groups and interpreting each group 
      as a big-endian integer in the range `0 ... 255`. If `b` is not divisible by `8`, then the data bits are first
      augmented by one binary `1` and up to six binary `0`, so as to make the number of data bits divisible by eight.
    - Finally, `r` cell references to cells $c_{j_1}, \ldots, c_{j_r}$ are encoded by means of `r` s-bit big-endian integers $j_1, \ldots, j_r$.
- Concatenate the representations of cells `ci` thus obtained in the increasing order of `i`.
- Optionally, an index can be constructed that consists of `n + 1` t-bit integer entries `L1, ..., Ln`, where `Li`
is the total length (in bytes) of the representations of cells `cj` with `j ≤ i`, and integer `t ≥ 0` is chosen so
that `Ln ≤ 2^t`. If the index is included, any cell `ci` the serialized bag of cells may be easily
accessed by its index `i` without deserializing all other cells, or even without
loading the entire serialized bag of cells in memory.
- The serialization of the bag of cells now consists of a magic number
indicating the precise format of the serialization, followed by integers
`s ≥ 0`, `t ≥ 0`, `n ≤ 2^s`, an optional index consisting of $\lceil\frac{(n+1)*t}{8}\rceil$ bytes,
and `Ln` bytes with the cell representations.
- An optional `CRC32C` may be appended to the serialization for integrity
verification purposes.

### A classification of serialization schemes for bags of cells

Each TL-B scheme for a bag of cells must specify the following parameters.
- The 4-byte magic number (name of TL-B constructor) prepended to the serialization.
- The number of bits `s` used to represent cell indices. Usually `s` is a multiple of eight.
- The number of bits `t` used to represent _offsets_ of cell serializations. Usually `t` is also a multiple of eight.
- A flag indicating whether an index with offsets `L1, ..., Ln` of cell serializations is present. This flag may be combined 
with `t` by setting `t = 0` when the index is absent.
- A flag indicating whether the `CRC32` of the whole serialization is appended to it for integrity verification purposes.
- The total number of cells `n` present in the serialization.
- The number of root cells `k ≤ n` present in the serialization. The root
cells themselves are $c_1, \ldots, c_{k}$. All other cells present in the bag of
cells are expected to be reachable by chains of references starting from
the root cells.
- The number of absent cells `l ≤ n − k`, which represent cells that are
actually absent from this bag of cells, but are referred to from it. The
absent cells themselves are represented by $c_{n−l+1}, \ldots, c_{n}$, and only
these cells may (and also must) have `r = 7`. Complete bags of cells
have `l = 0`.
- The total length in bytes `Ln` of the serialization of all cells. If the index
is present, `Ln` might not be stored explicitly since it can be recovered as the last entry of the index.

## A TL-B scheme

Only one [serialization scheme of BoCs](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/tl/boc.tlb#L25) 
is used in TON Blockchain:
```tlb
serialized_boc#b5ee9c72 has_idx:(## 1) has_crc32c:(## 1) 
  has_cache_bits:(## 1) flags:(## 2) { flags = 0 }
  size:(## 3) { size <= 4 }
  off_bytes:(## 8) { off_bytes <= 8 } 
  cells:(##(size * 8)) 
  roots:(##(size * 8)) { roots >= 1 }
  absent:(##(size * 8)) { roots + absent <= cells }
  tot_cells_size:(##(off_bytes * 8))
  root_list:(roots * ##(size * 8))
  index:has_idx?(cells * ##(off_bytes * 8))
  cell_data:(tot_cells_size * [ uint8 ])
  crc32c:has_crc32c?uint32
  = BagOfCells;
```
Field cells is `n`, `roots` is `k`, `absent` is `l`, and `tot_cells_size` is `Ln` (the total
size of the serialization of all cells in bytes). If an index is present, parameters
`s/8` and `t/8` are serialized separately as `size` and `off_bytes`, respectively,
and the flag `has_idx` is set. The index itself is contained in `index`, present
only if `has_idx` is set. The field `root_list` contains the (zero-based) indices
of the root nodes of the bag of cells.

There are also two outdated BoC serialization schemes in the same file.

## SDK from @ton/core

According to the TL-B scheme above there is the [SDK](https://github.com/ton-org/ton-core/blob/main/src/boc/cell/serialization.ts#L1) 
for serialization and parsing BoC.

Only serialization of BoCs with one root and no absent cells is supported.
```typescript
import { beginCell, serializeBoc } from "@ton/core";
// serializeBoc has two arguments:
// root: Cell. A root cell of a given tree of cells
// opt: { idx: boolean, crc32: boolean }. Two flags indicating whether indexes and CRC32C will be included in serialization

const innerCell = beginCell().storeUint(456, 16).endCell();

const rootCell = beginCell().storeUint(0, 64).storeRef(innerCell).endCell();

const serialized_boc = serializeBoc(rootCell, { idx: false, crc32: false });

const serialized_boc_with_indexes_and_crc32 = serializeBoc(rootCell, { idx: true, crc32: true });
```
