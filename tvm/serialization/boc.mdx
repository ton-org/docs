title: "Bag of cells"
---

Arbitrary data are represented in the TON Blockchain by trees of cells. Such a tree of cells is transformed into a
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of cells by identifying identical cells in the
tree. After that, each of the references of each cell might be replaced by the
32-byte [representation hash](/tvm/serialization/cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash) of the cell referred to. Thus a _bag of cells (BoC)_ is obtained.
In general, a BoC can be obtained from several trees of cells, thus forming a forest. By convention, the root of the original tree of
cells is a marked element of the resulting bag of cells, so that anybody receiving this bag of cells and knowing
the marked element can reconstruct the original DAG of cells, hence also the original tree of cells.
However, this BoC needs to be serialized into a file, suitable for disk storage or network transfer.

There may be many different ways to serialize such a data structure, each of which has its own goals and is convenient for specific cases.
This page provides a general serialization algorithm and specification of corresponding TL-B schemes,
followed by the example and specific implementation used in the TON Blockchain.

## General scheme

### Internal references, absent cells, and complete BoCs

Consider an arbitrary cell `c` in a given BoC. A reference of `c` is called _internal_ if
the cell corresponding to the reference is also represented in BoC. Otherwise, the reference is called _external_ and the corresponding
cell is called _absent_ from that BoC. In turn, a BoC is called _complete_ if it does not contain any external references.

Although most real-world cases only deal with complete BoCs, in general, the serialization of absent cells in BoC
differs from the serialization of included cells. Therefore, it is very important to be able to identify the type of references.

### Assigning indices to the cells from a bag of cells

In the process of BoC serialization, the assignment of indices of its cells plays an important role.
Let `c1, ..., cn` be the `n` distinct cells belonging to a bag of cells `B`.
The most used options are:

- Order cells by their representation hash. Thus `Hash(ci) < Hash(cj)` whenever `i < j`.
- [Topological order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

### Outline of serialization process

<Note>
  This and the following paragraphs provide a textual description of the Boc serialization process and the specifications of the TL-B schemas
  associated with it. The specific implementation of the serialization and TL-B schemes is left to the choice of developers.

  For a specific example of TL-B schema and pseudocode of related cell serialization, see [TL-B scheme](/tvm/serialization/boc#A-TL-B-scheme).
</Note>

The serialization process of a BoC `B` consisting of `n` cells can be outlined as follows.

- List the cells from B in a chosen order: `c1, ..., cn`(with `c1, ..., c_k` as root cells, if `B` is a forest).
- Choose an integer number `s`, such that `n ≤ 2^s`. Represent each cell `ci` by an integral number of bytes
  as in [standard representation cell algorithm](/tvm/serialization/cells#standard-cell-representation-and-its-hash), but:
  - `d1 = r + 8s + 16h + 32l` where `h = 1` if the cell’s hashes are explicitly included into the serialization; otherwise, `h = 0` (when `r = 7`, `h` must be `1`);
  - if `h = 1`, after bytes `b1` and `b2` the serialization is continued by `l + 1` 32-byte higher hashes of `c`;
  - unsigned big-endian s-bit integer `j` used instead of hash `Hash(cj)` to represent internal references to cell `cj`.
- Concatenate the representations of cells `ci` thus obtained in the increasing order of `i`.
- Optionally, an index can be constructed that consists of `n + 1` t-bit integer entries `L1, ..., Ln`, where `Li`
  is the total length (in bytes) of the representations of cells `cj` with `j ≤ i`, and integer `t ≥ 0` is chosen so
  that `Ln ≤ 2^t`. If the index is included, any cell `ci` the serialized bag of cells may be easily
  accessed by its index `i` without deserializing all other cells, or even without
  loading the entire serialized bag of cells in memory.
- The serialization of the bag of cells now consists of a magic number
  indicating the precise format of the serialization, followed by integers
  `s ≥ 0`, `t ≥ 0`, `n ≤ 2^s`, an optional index consisting of $\lceil\frac{(n+1)*t}{8}\rceil$ bytes,
  and `Ln` bytes with the cell representations.
- An optional `CRC32C` may be appended to the serialization for integrity
  verification purposes.

### A classification of serialization schemes for bags of cells

Each TL-B scheme for a bag of cells must specify the following parameters.

- The 4-byte magic number (name of TL-B constructor) prepended to the serialization.
- The number of bits `s` used to represent cell indices. Usually `s` is a multiple of eight.
- The number of bits `t` used to represent _offsets_ of cell serializations. Usually `t` is also a multiple of eight.
- A flag indicating whether an index with offsets `L1, ..., Ln` of cell serializations is present. This flag may be combined
  with `t` by setting `t = 0` when the index is absent.
- A flag indicating whether the `CRC32` of the whole serialization is appended to it for integrity verification purposes.
- The total number of cells `n` present in the serialization.
- The number of root cells `k ≤ n` present in the serialization. The root
  cells themselves are $c\_1, \ldots, c\_{k}$. All other cells present in the bag of
  cells are expected to be reachable by chains of references starting from
  the root cells.
- The number of absent cells `l ≤ n − k`, which represent cells that are
  actually absent from this bag of cells, but are referred to from it. The
  absent cells themselves are represented by $c\_{n−l+1}, \ldots, c\_{n}$, and only
  these cells may (and also must) have `r = 7`. Complete bags of cells
  have `l = 0`.
- The total length in bytes `Ln` of the serialization of all cells. If the index
  is present, `Ln` might not be stored explicitly since it can be recovered as the last entry of the index.

## A TL-B scheme

Only one [serialization scheme of BoCs](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/tl/boc.tlb#L25)
is used in TON Blockchain (there are also two outdated BoC serialization schemes in the file):

```tlb
serialized_boc#b5ee9c72 has_idx:(## 1) has_crc32c:(## 1) 
  has_cache_bits:(## 1) flags:(## 2) { flags = 0 }
  size:(## 3) { size <= 4 }
  off_bytes:(## 8) { off_bytes <= 8 } 
  cells:(##(size * 8)) 
  roots:(##(size * 8)) { roots >= 1 }
  absent:(##(size * 8)) { roots + absent <= cells }
  tot_cells_size:(##(off_bytes * 8))
  root_list:(roots * ##(size * 8))
  index:has_idx?(cells * ##(off_bytes * 8))
  cell_data:(tot_cells_size * [ uint8 ])
  crc32c:has_crc32c?uint32
  = BagOfCells;
```

Field `cells` is `n`, `roots` is `k`, `absent` is `l`, and `tot_cells_size` is `Ln` (the total
size of the serialization of all cells in bytes). If an index is present, parameters
`s/8` and `t/8` are serialized separately as `size` and `off_bytes`, respectively,
and the flag `has_idx` is set. The index itself is contained in `index`, present
only if `has_idx` is set. The field `root_list` contains the (zero-based) indices
of the root nodes of the bag of cells. Finally, `cell_data` is a sequence of bits that obtained as a concatenation of the cells representations:

```c
// d1
uint3 level_mask;
uint1 has_hashes;
uint1 is_exotic;
uint3 ref_count;

// d2
if ref_count < 7 {
    uint7 byte_size;
    uint1 has_padding;
}
        
if has_hashes {
    uint256 hashes[GetLevel(level_mask) + 1];
    uint16 depths[GetLevel(level_mask) + 1];
}
        
if ref_count < 7 {
    if byte_size + has_padding != 0 {
        uint8 data_bits[byte_size + has_padding];
    }
    ref refs[ref_count];
}
```

## An example of a manual serialization

Let's consider the following example of a tree of cells:

```json
01
  0aaaaa
  fe
    0aaaaa
```

So, there is a 2-bit root cell that references two other cells:

- The first is a 24-bit cell.
- The second is a 8-bit cell that itself references a 24-bit cell.

After identifying of unique cells, we have the following:

```json
01
0aaaaa
fe
```

Next, the unique cells are arranged in a topological order:

```json
01     -> index 0 (root cell)
fe     -> index 1
0aaaaa -> index 2
```

Now, let’s calculate the descriptor bytes `b1` and `b2` for each of the three unique cells.

So, we obtain:

```json
01     -> 0201
fe     -> 0102
0aaaaa -> 0006
```

Then the data bits are serialized as $\lceil\frac{b}{8}\rceil$ bytes. Remember, if `b` is not a multiple of eight, a binary `1`
and up to six binary `0s` are appended to the data bits. After that, the data is split into $\lceil\frac{b}{8}\rceil$ 8-bit groups.

```json
01     -> 01100000 = 0x60
fe     -> do not change (full groups)
0aaaaa -> do not change (full groups)
```

Next come the depths for the refs in two bytes:

```json
01     -> 0002
fe     -> 0001
0aaaaa -> 0000
```

Now specify which cells each one references:

```json
0: 01     -> 0201: refers to 2 cells with such indexes
1: fe     -> 02: refers to cells with index 2
2: 0aaaaa -> no refs
```

For each cell we have its hexadecimal representation:

```json
01     -> 02016000020201
fe     -> 0102fe000102
0aaaaa -> 00060aaaaa0000
```

Finally, we concatenate all parts into a single hexadecimal array:
`0x020160000202010102fe00010200060aaaaa0000`.

Now that we've serialized our cells into a flat 20-byte array, it's time to pack them into a complete BoC format.

```
0xb5ee9c72                                 -> Tl-B id of the BoC structure
0b1                                        -> has indexes
0b0                                        -> does not have CRC32C
0b0                                        -> does not have cache bits
0b00                                       -> flags are 0
0b001                                      -> the number of bytes needed to store the number of cells is 1
0b00000001                                 -> the number of bytes used to represent offset of a serialization is 1
0b00000011                                 -> the number of cells is 3
0b00000001                                 -> the number of roots is 1
0b00000000                                 -> the number of absent cells is 0
0b00010100                                 -> tot_cells_size is 20 bytes
0b00000000                                 -> the root list; we have one root with number 0 after the topological sort
0b000001110000111000010100                 -> the three 8-bits group of indexes for cells accorging to the topological sort
0x020160000202010102fe00010200060aaaaa0000 -> the cells data
_                                          -> CRC32C is not serialized
```

By combining everything into a single bit string, we get the result of serialization.

## SDK from @ton/core

According to the TL-B scheme above there is the [SDK](https://github.com/ton-org/ton-core/blob/main/src/boc/cell/serialization.ts#L1)
for serialization and parsing BoC.

Only serialization of BoCs with one root and no absent cells is supported.

```typescript
import { beginCell, serializeBoc, deserializeBoc } from "@ton/core";
// serializeBoc has two arguments:
// root: Cell. A root cell of a given tree of cells
// opt: { idx: boolean, crc32: boolean }. Two flags indicating whether indexes and CRC32C will be included in serialization
// the output is a Buffer with serialization

const innerCell = beginCell().storeUint(456, 16).endCell();

const rootCell = beginCell().storeUint(0, 64).storeRef(innerCell).endCell();

const serialized_boc = serializeBoc(rootCell, { idx: false, crc32: false });

const serialized_boc_with_indexes_and_crc32 = serializeBoc(rootCell, {
    idx: true,
    crc32: true,
});

// deserializeBoc has one argument, src: a Buffer that contains a serialized BoC
// the output is roots list of a given BoC

const roots_of_first_boc = deserializeBoc(serialized_boc);

const roots_of_second_boc = deserializeBoc(
    serialized_boc_with_indexes_and_crc32,
);
```
