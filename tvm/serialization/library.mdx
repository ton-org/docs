Library cells allows to extend deduplication mechanism on-chain. This significantly reduces the size of serialized data
and enables efficient storage of incrementally updated data. For the details see [library cells page](/ton/cells/library-cells).
Always has level zero, so dows not contain any higher hashes.

Each library cell is serialized as follows:
- The 1-byte tag that always equals to `0x02`.
- The 256-bit [representation hash](/tvm/serialization/cells) of the library cell being referred to.
