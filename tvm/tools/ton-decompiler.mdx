[**Ton Decompiler**](https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-opcode) is a powerful utility for analyzing and reverse-engineering smart contracts deployed on The Open Network (TON). It transforms compiled TVM bytecode (represented as a `Cell`) back into human-readable pseudocode resembling **Func/Fift**, greatly simplifying contract auditing, verification, and comprehension.

## Features

- **Decompiles TVM bytecode** into structured pseudocode
- Supports complex constructs: dictionaries, global variables, built-in functions, hashes, signatures, and more
- Recovers procedures and methods by their hashes (`?fun_ref_xxx`)
- Integrates with `@ton/core`, `@ton-community/func-js`, and `@scaleton/func-debug-symbols`
- End-to-end testing via **Vitest** with round-trip compilation/decompilation validation
- Generates code hashes for verification (used in Tact contract tests)

## Testing and verification

The tool is extensively tested against a wide range of contracts:

- **Tact contracts**: Jetton, NFT, Vesting, Lottery, SkatePassport, and more
- **Func contracts**: `jetton-minter.fc`, `nft-collection.fc`, `wallet v3/v4`, `stdlib.fc`, `mathlib.fc`
- Supports contracts compiled via **Func**, **Tact**, and **Fift**

Each test validates:

- Correctness of decompilation output
- Re-compilability via Fift
- Hash stability (`exports[...] = "..."` in test snapshots)

## Architecture

### Core modules

- **`disasm`** — TVM instruction disassembler
- **`AssemblyWriter`** — generates readable assembly with configurable options:
  - Instruction aliases (e.g., `SWAP` instead of `s0 s1 XCHG`)
  - Inline hex comments (e.g., `// 0xD0`)
  - Resolution of procedure and method names
- **`utils/known-methods`** — registry of known method IDs and debug symbols
- **`e2e/utils`** — utilities for compilation and result comparison

### Supported TVM instructions

- Arithmetic (`DIVMOD`, `LSHIFT`, `MULRSHIFTR#`, and more)
- Dictionary operations (`DICTGET`, `DICTSETB`, `DICTDEL`, `DICTUREMMIN`, and more)
- Stack manipulation (`XCHG`, `PUXC`, `BLKSWAP`)
- Control flow (`IFELSE`, `WHILE`, `CALLREF`, `INLINECALLDICT`)
- Cell and slice handling (`CTOS`, `STREF`, `LDREF`, `STSLICECONST`)

## Installation and usage

```bash
npm install @tact-lang/ton-decompiler
# or clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tact-lang/ton-decompiler.git
```

### Example usage

```ts
import { Cell } from "@ton/core";
import { disassembleRoot } from "./decompiler/disasm";
import { AssemblyWriter } from "./printer/assembly-writer";

const cell: Cell = ...; // your TVM contract bytecode
const program = disassembleRoot(cell);
const writer = new AssemblyWriter();
const code = writer.write(program);
console.log(code);
```

## For developers

- **Tests**: Run with `vitest`; cover hundreds of real-world contracts
- **Specification generation**: `npm run gen-spec`
- **Linting**: `eslint` with modern rules
- **Compatibility**: Integrates with `@tact-lang/compiler` and `tact-template`

## Why use it?

- **Security auditing**: Analyze third-party contracts without source code
- **Reverse engineering**: Understand the logic of closed-source contracts
- **Education**: Learn TVM internals and low-level TON contract behavior
- **IDE integration**: Enable decompilation features in development tools

> **Note**: Decompiled code may not exactly match the original source — variable names and high-level structure can differ — but semantic equivalence is preserved.
