[Retracer](https://retracer.ton.org/) is a classic TVM transaction tracing tool that provides detailed inspection of transaction execution. It's useful for:

- Understanding complex transaction flows;
- Debugging smart contract behavior;
- Analyzing gas usage and performance.

Some explorers display links to Retracer on their transaction pages. Otherwise it's recommended to use a more modern [TxTracer](/tvm/tools/txtracer) tool.

Its source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tvm-web-viewer/).

On this screenshot, key elements of its interface are visible:

- Transaction details — Sender, contract, amounts, time, LT, fees, and balances;
- **C5** button — Display action list: complete details of all actions performed during the transaction;
- **Logs** button — Detailed logs for deeper debugging;
- List of instructions (on the left) — Steps taken by execution of the contract on TVM;
- Stack (on the right) — Stack during execution of current instruction.
