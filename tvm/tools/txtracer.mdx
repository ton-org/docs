[TxTracer](https://txtracer.ton.org/) is a modern TVM transaction tracing tool that combines multiple debugging and analysis features in one interface.

## Features

1. Tracing TVM execution with transaction details and logs
1. Interactive environment for experimenting with TVM assembly and FunC
1. Convert FunC/Tolk code to TVM assembly and explore how it is compiled
1. Built-in reference for TVM opcodes, stack effects, and control flow
1. Sandbox UI extends the standard `@ton/sandbox` with transaction tracing capabilities, allowing you to visualize and debug smart contract interactions.
1. Emulate transaction tree using your BoC message

## Use cases

- **Transaction tracing** — Follow execution path and stack changes end-to-end
- **Assembly experimentation** — Test and compile code, inspect VM behavior in real-time
- **Instruction lookup** — Find TVM instruction semantics while reading disassembly
- **Error investigation** — Debug invalid opcodes and type errors using instruction constraints
- **Debugging** — Debug smart contracts using it with sandbox
