[TVM Explorer](https://tvm-explorer.netlify.app/) is an interactive tool for exploring TVM assembly. Use it to see how your [Fift](/languages/fift) code compiles to TVM assembly. It allows

- examining TVM bitcode and understanding instruction behavior;
- seeing how Fift code translates to TVM instructions.

For more modern languages use TxTracer's [Playground](/tvm/tools/txtracer#2-playground).
