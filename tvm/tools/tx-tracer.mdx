TxTracer is a modern TVM transaction tracing tool that combines multiple debugging and analysis features in one interface.

## Features

- **Retracer-style tracing** — End-to-end transaction tracing similar to Retracer
- **Assembly playground** — Interactive environment for experimenting with TVM assembly
- **Code explorer** — Convert FunC/Tolk code to TVM and explore the results
- **TVM specification** — Built-in reference for opcodes, stack effects, and control flow
- **Sandbox visualization** — Visual representation of TVM execution

## Use cases

- **Instruction lookup** — Find TVM instruction semantics while reading disassembly
- **Error investigation** — Debug invalid opcodes and type errors using instruction constraints
- **Transaction tracing** — Follow execution path and stack changes end-to-end
- **Assembly experimentation** — Test and compile code, inspect VM logs from local tests

## Getting started

Access TxTracer through its web interface to start exploring TVM execution and debugging transactions.
