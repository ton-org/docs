  **Deprecated:** Highload Wallet v2 is a legacy contract. Use [Highload Wallet v3](/standard/wallets/highload/v3/specification) for new deployments.

  This specification is maintained for reference to support existing legacy systems.
</Aside>

This page provides a complete technical specification for Highload Wallet v2, covering storage structure, message formats, replay protection, and limitations.

## What is Highload Wallet v2?

Highload Wallet v2 is a specialized wallet contract designed for services that need to send many transactions in a short time. It uses dictionary-based replay protection to enable parallel transaction submission.

**Key difference from standard wallets:**\
Unlike seqno-based wallets that require sequential transaction processing, Highload v2 stores processed request identifiers in a dictionary, enabling parallel submissions.

**Replaced by:** [Highload Wallet v3](/standard/wallets/highload/v3/specification)

## TL-B schema

[TL-B (Type Language - Binary)](/languages/TL-B/overview) is a domain-specific language designed to describe data structures in TON. The schemas below define the binary layout of the contract's storage and external messages.

### Storage structure

```tlb
storage$_ subwallet_id:uint32 last_cleaned:uint64 public_key:bits256
          queries:(HashmapE 64 Cell) = Storage;
```

### Query ID structure

```tlb
_ query_id:uint64 = QueryId;
```

### External message structure

```tlb
_ mode:uint8 message:^Cell = OutListNode;

msg_body$_ signature:bits512 subwallet_id:uint32 query_id:uint64 
          messages:(HashmapE 16 Cell) = ExternalInMsgBody;
```

## Storage structure

The Highload Wallet v2 contract stores four persistent fields (in this order):

### `subwallet_id` (32 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Allows a single keypair to control multiple wallets with different addresses.

**How it works:**\
The `subwallet_id` is part of the contract's initial state. Changing it produces a different contract address. Each external message must include the correct `subwallet_id`; mismatches result in transaction failure.

---

### `last_cleaned` (64 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Timestamp (in query\_id format) of the oldest query that was kept during the last cleanup.

**How it works:**\
During each transaction, the contract removes queries older than **64 seconds** from the `queries` dictionary. The `last_cleaned` field tracks the last query ID that was removed.

**Cleanup logic:**

```func
bound -= (64 << 32);  // Clean up records expired more than 64 seconds ago
```

Queries with `query_id < (now() - 64) << 32` are removed from storage.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  **Gas costs:** Cleanup operations consume gas proportional to the number of expired queries. With many expired queries, cleanup can exceed the 1,000,000 gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.
</Aside>

---

### `public_key` (256 bits)

**Purpose:**\
The Ed25519 public key is used to verify signatures on incoming external messages.

**How it works:**\
When the wallet receives an external message, it verifies that the 512-bit signature was created by the holder of the private key corresponding to this public key.

---

### `queries` (HashmapE 64 Cell)

**Purpose:**\
Stores processed `query_id` values for replay protection.

**Structure:**

- **Key:** 64-bit `query_id`
- **Value:** Cell containing metadata (typically the timestamp when processed)

**How it works:**\
Before processing a message, the contract checks if `query_id` exists in `queries`. If found, the message is rejected (replay attack). If not found, the `query_id` is added to `queries`, and the message is processed.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  **Storage limit:** The `queries` dictionary cannot exceed 65,535 cells. If this limit is reached, the contract will fail during the action phase.
</Aside>

## External message structure

### Message layout

```text
signature:bits512
subwallet_id:uint32
query_id:uint64
messages:(HashmapE 16 Cell)
```

**Key point:**\
Unlike v3, in v2 the signature is in the **same cell** as the message body, not in a separate reference cell.

### `signature` (512 bits)

**Type:**\
Ed25519 signature (512 bits).

**What is signed:**\
The hash of the remaining slice after the signature, containing `subwallet_id`, `query_id`, and `messages`.

**From source code:**

```func
throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
```

The contract uses `slice_hash()` on the message body after loading the signature.

---

### `subwallet_id` (32 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Identifies which subwallet this message targets.

**Validation:**\
Must match the `subwallet_id` stored in contract storage.

---

### `query_id` (64 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Unique identifier for replay protection and timestamp validation.

**Structure:**\
The 64-bit value is internally interpreted as a timestamped identifier:

- High 32 bits: Unix timestamp (seconds)
- Low 32 bits: counter within that second

**Validation:**\
The contract checks `query_id >= now() << 32`, ensuring the query ID is not from the past (based on the current time shifted left by 32 bits).

**Total unique IDs:**\
Approximately **32,000** unique query IDs (limited by the cleanup mechanism and the bitmap structure).

---

### `messages` (HashmapE 16)

**Purpose:**\
Dictionary of messages to send in this transaction.

**Structure:**

- **Key:** `uint16` (message index, 0 to 65,535)
- **Value:** `mode:uint8` + `^Cell` (reference to internal message)

**How it works:**\
The contract iterates through the dictionary and sends each message with its corresponding send mode:

```func
int i = -1;
do {
  (i, var cs, var f) = dict.idict_get_next?(16, i);
  if (f) {
    var mode = cs~load_uint(8);
    send_raw_message(cs~load_ref(), mode);
  }
} until (~ f);
```

**Max batch size:**\
Up to **255 messages** (limited by action list size, not dictionary structure).

---

## Replay protection mechanism

### Validation sequence

1. **Check query\_id timestamp:** `query_id >= now() << 32` (exit code `35` if too old)
1. **Check replay:** `query_id` must not be in `queries` (exit code `32` if already processed)
1. **Check subwallet:** `subwallet_id == stored_subwallet` (exit code `34` if mismatch)
1. **Verify signature:** Ed25519 signature verification (exit code `35` if invalid)
1. **Mark as processed:** Add `query_id` to `queries`
1. **Send messages:** Iterate through the message dictionary and send each message
1. **Cleanup:** Remove queries older than 64 seconds

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  **Rollback issue:** Highload Wallet v2 does not use `commit()` to persist storage changes. If the compute phase fails after `accept_message()` (e.g., gas limit exceeded during cleanup) or if the action phase fails, **all changes roll back**, including replay protection. The `query_id` is not marked as processed, and lite-servers will retry the same message, burning gas repeatedly.

  Highload Wallet v3 solves this with `commit()` and a two-transaction pattern. See [Why internal messages to self?](/standard/wallets/highload/v3/specification#why-internal-messages-to-self) for details.

## Limitations and constraints

### Storage size limit

**Limit:**\
The `queries` dictionary cannot exceed **65,535 cells**.

**What happens if exceeded:**\
An exception is thrown during the action phase, and the transaction fails. The failed transaction may be replayed, potentially locking funds.

### Gas limit for cleanup

**Limit:**\
Transaction gas limit is **1,000,000 gas**.

**What happens if exceeded:**\
Cleanup operations that exceed this limit will fail, preventing the contract from processing new transactions.

**Recommended limits:**

- Queries within expiration window: ≤ 1,000
- Queries cleaned per transaction: ≤ 100

### Query ID expiration

**Expiration time:**\
Queries older than **64 seconds** are removed from storage during cleanup.

**Effective limit:**\
With the 64-second expiration window and recommended limit of ≤1,000 queries per window, the effective query ID space is approximately **32,000** unique IDs before cleanup is required.

**Returns:**

- `-1` (true) — the `query_id` was processed and is still stored in `queries`
