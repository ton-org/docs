Highload Wallets are specialized wallet contracts designed for services that need to send hundreds of transactions per second, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, payment processors, and high-volume trading platforms.

## What makes them different

Unlike standard wallets (v3, v4, v5) that use sequential processing with a `seqno` counter, Highload Wallets (v2 and v3) store processed request identifiers in a dictionary, enabling **parallel transaction submission** without blocking.

**Standard wallet limitation:**\
Each transaction must wait for the previous one to complete. If you send 100 transactions, they must process sequentially: transaction 2 waits for transaction 1, transaction 3 waits for transaction 2, and so on.

**Highload Wallet advantage:**\
You can send 100, 1,000, 100,000 transactions simultaneously. Each transaction uses a unique `query_id` instead of a sequential `seqno`, allowing parallel processing without conflicts.

## Version history

### Highload Wallet v1

The first highload wallet, using a simple `seqno` counter:

- **Simple seqno-based:** Sequential processing like standard wallets
- **Batch support:** Could send up to 255 messages per transaction
- **Replay protection rollback:** If the action phase failed, replay protection would roll back (same issue as standard wallets v1-v4)

### Highload Wallet v2

Improved version with dictionary-based replay protection:

- **Fund locking risk:** Under certain conditions, the contract could enter a state where funds became inaccessible
- **High gas costs:** Storage updates and cleanup operations consumed excessive gas
- **Replay protection rollback:** If the action phase failed, replay protection would roll back (same issue as v1 and standard wallets)

  **Legacy contracts:** Highload Wallet v1 and v2 are deprecated. Use Highload Wallet v3 for all new deployments.
</Aside>

### Highload Wallet v3

The current recommended version, redesigned to solve all previous architectural problems:

- **More requests:** Up to 8,380,416 unique query IDs with efficient rotation
- **Lower gas costs:** Optimized cleanup and storage operations
- **Maximum safety:** Architectural design prevents fund locking; impossible to break
- **Guaranteed replay protection:** Unlike v1, v2, and standard wallets v1-v4, replay protection **never rolls back** even if the action phase fails. The two-transaction pattern ensures the `query_id` is always committed before attempting to send messages.
