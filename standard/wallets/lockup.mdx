Lockup Wallet is a specialized wallet contract that temporarily locks TON funds for a specified period. The repository contains two implementations with different unlocking mechanisms.

## What makes it different

Unlike standard wallets that allow immediate fund withdrawal, Lockup Wallet implements time-based restrictions that prevent premature fund access.

**Standard wallet behavior:**\
You can send funds immediately after receiving them.

**Lockup Wallet behavior:**\
Funds are locked until a specified time, then unlock according to the contract mechanism.

  Lockup Wallet is deprecated. Use [Vesting Contract](/standard/vesting) for new deployments.

## Available contracts

The repository contains two wallet contracts with different unlocking mechanisms:

| Feature | Universal Lockup Wallet | Vesting Wallet |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Locking mechanism | Single unlock date | Cliff period + gradual unlocks |
| Unlock pattern | All funds unlock at once | Gradual unlocking over time |
| Use cases | Simple lockups, escrow | Employee vesting, long-term investments |
| Complexity | Lower | Higher |

## How it works

### Universal Lockup Wallet

Simple time-based locking where all funds unlock at once:

1. Initial lock: All funds are locked until unlock date
2. Complete unlock: All funds become available simultaneously

Example:
```
Amount: 100,000 TON
Lock Period: 1 year
Result: All 100,000 TON unlock simultaneously after 1 year
```

### Vesting Wallet

Gradual unlocking with optional cliff periods:

1. Initial lock: All funds are locked until `vesting_start_time`
2. Cliff period: Optional period where no funds unlock
3. Gradual unlock: After cliff, funds unlock in regular intervals
4. Full access: Eventually all funds become available

Example:
```
Total: 1,000,000 TON
Vesting: 10 years, 1-year cliff
Result: 0 TON for 12 months, then ~8,333 TON/month
```

## Use cases

### Universal Lockup Wallet
- Escrow services: Lock funds until conditions are met
- Simple lockups: Basic time-based restrictions
- Temporary holds: Short-term fund locking

### Vesting Wallet
- Employee token vesting: Lock employee tokens for 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Investment lockups: Lock investor funds for predetermined periods
- Long-term savings: Personal long-term investment strategies
