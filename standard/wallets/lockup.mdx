title: "Lockup Wallet"

Lockup wallet is a wallet contract that locks TON funds until a specified time. Unlike standard wallets that allow immediate withdrawal, lockup wallets prevent fund access before the unlock date.

## Available contracts

The repository contains two wallet contracts:

| Feature        | Universal Lockup Wallet  | Vesting Wallet                |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Unlock pattern | All funds unlock at once | Gradual unlocking over time   |
| Use cases      | Simple lockups, escrow   | Employee vesting, investments |

## How it works

### Universal Lockup Wallet

1. Funds remain locked until the specified unlock date
1. After unlock date, all funds become available simultaneously

Example:

```text
Amount: 100,000 TON
Lock period: 1 year
Result: All 100,000 TON unlock after 1 year
```

### Vesting Wallet

1. Funds remain locked until `vesting_start_time`
1. Optional cliff period where no funds unlock
1. After cliff, funds unlock in regular intervals
1. Eventually all funds become available

Example:

```text
Total: 1,000,000 TON
Vesting: 10 years, 1-year cliff
Result: 0 TON for 12 months, then ~8,333 TON/month
```

## Use cases

### Universal Lockup Wallet

- Escrow services: Lock funds until conditions are met
- Simple lockups: Basic time-based restrictions
- Temporary holds: Short-term fund locking

### Vesting Wallet

- Employee token vesting: Lock employee tokens for 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Investment lockups: Lock investor funds for predetermined periods
- Long-term savings: Personal long-term investment strategies
