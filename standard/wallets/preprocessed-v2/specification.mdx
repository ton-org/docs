</Aside>

## What is Preprocessed Wallet V2?

Preprocessed Wallet V2 is a wallet smart contract designed for efficiency with minimal code complexity. It provides low transaction costs while maintaining the ability to send up to 255 actions in a single transaction.

**Key difference from standard wallets:**\
Preprocessed V2 enables batch transaction processing with up to 255 actions per message, making it suitable for services that need to send multiple payments efficiently.

**Optimization focus:**\
Preprocessed V2 prioritizes gas efficiency and simplicity, making it suitable for applications that need batch processing with minimal overhead.

**Gas consumption:**\
The wallet consumes 1537 gas units per transaction.

## TL-B schema

[TL-B (Type Language - Binary)](/languages/TL-B/overview) is a domain-specific language designed to describe data structures in TON. The schemas below define the binary layout of the contract's storage and external messages.

### Storage structure

```tlb
storage$_ pub_key:bits256 seq_no:uint16 = Storage;
```

### External message structure

```tlb
_ {n:#} valid_until:uint64 seq_no:uint16 actions:^(OutList n) { n <= 255 } = MsgInner n;

msg_body$_ {n:#} sign:bits512 ^(MsgInner n) = ExtInMsgBody n;
```

<Aside type="note">
  The canonical TL-B schemas are maintained in the [ton-preprocessed-wallet-v2 repository](https://github.com/pyAndr3w/ton-preprocessed-wallet-v2).
</Aside>

Below, each field is explained in detail.

## Storage structure

The Preprocessed Wallet V2 contract stores two persistent fields:

### `pub_key` (256 bits)

**Purpose:**\
An Ed25519 public key is used to verify signatures on incoming external messages.

**How it works:**\
When the wallet receives an external message, it verifies that the 512-bit signature was created by the holder of the private key corresponding to this public key.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  The public key is not the wallet address. The address is derived from the contract's `StateInit` (code + initial data). See [Addresses in TON](/foundations/addresses/overview) for details.
</Aside>

### `seq_no` (16 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Prevents replay attacks by ensuring each message has a unique sequence number.

**How it works:**\
Each external message must contain the correct `seq_no` that matches the current value stored in the contract. After successful processing, the sequence number is incremented (with modulo 2^16 to prevent overflow).

**Range:** 0 to 65535 (wraps from 65535 to 0)

**Size optimization:**\
The sequence number is limited to 16 bits (instead of 32 bits used in other wallets) to minimize storage size and message size, reducing gas costs.

**Protection mechanism:**\
Even if an attacker intercepts an old message, they cannot replay it because the sequence number will no longer match the current value in storage.

**Wrap‑around note:**\
See [Replay protection mechanism](#replay-protection-mechanism) for guidance on wrap‑around and `valid_until` windows.

## External message structure

External messages sent to Preprocessed Wallet V2 have a specific layout.

### Message layout

```text
sign:bits512
^[ valid_until:uint64
   seq_no:uint16
   actions:^(OutList n) ]
```

**Key point:**\
The signature is in the root cell (512 bits); all other parameters are in a reference cell (`MsgInner`).

<Aside
  type="tip"
  title="Gas optimization"
>
  This structure saves gas units during signature verification. If the signature were in the same cell as the message body, the contract would need to use `slice_hash()` (which rebuilds the cell internally, costing extra gas) instead of simply taking `cell_hash()` of the reference.
</Aside>

---

### `sign` (512 bits)

**Type:**\
Ed25519 signature (512 bits).

**What is signed:**\
The hash of the reference cell (`MsgInner`) containing `valid_until`, `seq_no`, and `actions`.

**Validation:**\
The contract verifies the signature using:

```func
check_signature(hash(ref_cell), signature, public_key)
```

**On failure:**\
Exit code `35`.

**Link:** [Ed25519 signature scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519)

---

### `valid_until` (64 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Unix timestamp (seconds) when the external message expires.

**Validation:**\
The contract performs a single check:

```func
now() > valid_until  // Message expired
```

**On failure:**\
Exit code `34`.

**Why it matters:**\
Prevents replay of expired messages. If `now() > valid_until`, the message is considered expired and rejected.

**Recommendation:**\
Set `valid_until` to 1 minute (60 seconds) from message creation time.

---

### `seq_no` (16 bits)

**Purpose:**\
Expected sequence number for this message.

**Validation:**\
Must match the current `seq_no` stored in contract storage.

**On mismatch:**\
Exit code `33`.

### `actions` (reference cell)

**Structure:**\
A serialized `OutList` containing up to 255 actions to execute.

**Validation:**\
No validation.

**Supported actions:**
All standard TVM actions are supported without restrictions:

- `action_send_msg` — Send messages
- `action_set_code` — Update contract code
- `action_reserve_currency` — Reserve currency
- `action_change_library` — Change library

<Aside
  type="danger"
  title="Critical security warning"
>
  Preprocessed Wallet V2 does not protect against `action_set_code` actions. If you accidentally include a `set_code` action in your message, the wallet contract code will be changed, potentially making your funds inaccessible. Always verify your action lists before sending.
</Aside>

**Maximum actions:** 255 (maximum number of out actions in TON)

## Replay protection mechanism

Preprocessed Wallet V2 uses sequence numbers and time-based expiration to prevent replay attacks.

### Sequence number protection

**How it works:**

1. Each message must contain the correct `seq_no`
1. After successful processing, `seq_no` is incremented
1. Old messages with incorrect sequence numbers are rejected

**Overflow protection:**

- Uses modulo 2^16 operation: `(seq_no + 1) % 65536`
- Wraps from 65535 to 0

### Time-based expiration

**How it works:**

1. Each message includes `valid_until` timestamp
1. Messages are rejected if `now() > valid_until`
1. Prevents replay of expired messages

**Recommended expiration:**

- 1 minute (60 seconds) for most use cases
- Shorter for high-frequency operations
- Longer for batch operations with network delays

### Wrap‑around and validity window

When `seq_no` wraps (65535 → 0), previously sent messages that used the same numeric `seq_no` remain non‑applicable if their `valid_until` has already expired. Safety relies on the dual check: current `seq_no` equality and unexpired `valid_until`.

Do not set `valid_until` excessively far in the future. A very long validity window increases the chance that, after wrap‑around, an old message with the same `seq_no` is still valid. Keep the window short (for example, ≤ 60 seconds) unless you have a specific operational reason.

### Signature verification

**How it works:**

1. All messages must be signed with the wallet's private key
1. Signature covers the entire message content (hash of `MsgInner`)
1. Prevents unauthorized message creation

## Exit codes

| Exit code | Name                      | Description                                        | How to fix                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Success                   | Message processed successfully                     | —                                                                               |
| `33`      | Incorrect sequence number | The `seq_no` in the message does not match storage | Use the correct `seq_no` from contract storage                                  |
| `34`      | Message expired           | The `valid_until` timestamp has passed             | Ensure `valid_until >= now()` when creating the message                         |
| `35`      | Invalid signature         | Ed25519 signature verification failed              | Check that the private key is correct and the message hash is computed properly |

## Limitations and constraints

### Maximum actions per transaction

**Limitation:**\
Each external message can trigger up to 255 actions.

**Why this limitation?**\
255 is the maximum number of out actions supported by TON blockchain. This is a fundamental limitation of the TVM execution environment.

**Impact:**\
Suitable for batch operations with up to 255 actions per transaction.

<Aside
  type="note"
  title="Sequential processing"
>
  Preprocessed Wallet V2 uses sequential `seq_no` processing. This means you must wait for each transaction to complete before sending the next one.
