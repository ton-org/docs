title: "Comparison"
---

[Unlike some other blockchains](/from-ethereum), wallets in TON are represented as distinct smart contracts. They handle transaction signing, replay protection, and even gasless transfers. Different wallet versions implement different custom logic, suitable for various use cases.

This article will cover the differences between these wallets and identify the best pick for each task.

## Comparison table

<sup>1</sup> Seqno means "sequential number" - a persistent unsigned integer variable, which is incremented by 1 for each valid transaction submission. Also, sometimes it's called "nonce". It is a common way to implement replay protection.<br />
<sup>2</sup> "Gasless" is the kind of a transaction that doesn't require native currency to pay network fees.

## Use cases

### Retail users

If you are new to TON and want to create your first wallet to engage with the ecosystem, **v4** and **v5** are your best choices.

All major wallet apps support both standards and implement secure cryptography to ensure users' funds are safe.

It is recommended to use the v5 wallet standard, since it's the latest and most powerful implementation to date. It supports gasless transactions and up to 255 out messages per one signed external request.

**Use for**:

- **Buying stablecoins**: Purchase USDT and other stable assets
- **Trading Jettons**: Swap tokens on DEXes and participate in DeFi
- **Daily payments**: Send and receive TON for everyday transactions
- **NFT collecting**: Buy, sell, and store digital collectibles
- **Staking**: Participate in TON validation and earn rewards
- **DApp interactions**: Connect to games, social apps, and other TON applications
- **Savings**: Store cryptocurrency for long-term holding

**Key benefits:**

- Simple setup with any major TON wallet app
- Low transaction fees for everyday use
- Battle-tested security with millions of users
- Full ecosystem compatibility

### Shared custody

For experienced institutional managers and fund operators with high security demands, **Multisig wallets are your best choice** when managing institutional funds, treasury assets, or any situation requiring shared custody.

Multisig wallets provide the highest level of security through distributed control:

- **Shared responsibility**: No single person can move funds alone
- **Configurable thresholds**: Set up 2-of-3, 3-of-5, or any N-of-M configuration
- **Audit trails**: Every transaction requires multiple approvals, creating clear accountability
- **Risk mitigation**: Protects against key compromise, insider threats, and human error

**Key considerations:**

- Higher transaction costs due to multiple signature verification
- Longer processing time as multiple parties must sign
- Requires coordination between signers for each transaction
- More complex setup and key management procedures

While the operational overhead is higher than that of single-signature wallets, the security benefits make multisig essential for any custodial operation handling significant assets or requiring regulatory compliance.

### Payment gateways

For businesses operating payment gateways, exchanges, or services requiring high-volume transaction processing, **Highload wallets are your best choice** when handling thousands of payments and withdrawals efficiently.

Highload wallets are engineered explicitly for maximum throughput and cost efficiency:

- **Massive throughput**: Process up to 8,380,415 requests with up to 254 outgoing messages (total maximum of up to 2 billion outgoing messages) per timeout period
- **Query-based processing**: Uses `query id` and `batch id` instead of seqno for better transaction submission tracking. They help discover individual transaction submissions

**Use for:**

- **Cryptocurrency exchanges**: Handle thousands of user withdrawals and deposits
- **Payment processors**: Process merchant payments and payouts at scale
- **Trading platforms**: Execute high-frequency trading operations

**Key considerations:**

- Requires technical expertise for proper implementation
- More complex setup compared to standard wallets
- Need robust monitoring and error handling systems

## Performance benchmarks

The following benchmarks compare gas consumption and throughput across different wallet versions when sending multiple messages. These measurements help determine the most cost-effective wallet for specific use cases.

Each benchmark includes theoretical and real-time measurements. Theoretically, messages can be sent every 3-5 seconds when a new block appears. In practice, messages can be sent every 15-17 seconds due to network conditions and block confirmation times.

<Note>
The benchmarks measure the gas consumed by the wallet contract itself, including `fwd_fee` and gas costs. The final transaction fee may vary depending on the destination address and message processing requirements.
</Note>

<Note>
Preprocessed Wallet V2 is shown in separate tables because it is a community implementation and not an official TON standard. Users assume all risks when using this wallet implementation. Always verify the contract code and understand the security implications before use.
