Restricted Wallet is a specialized wallet contract that restricts transfers to predefined owner address, and some operations with Elector and Config contracts. It is used in [Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) project to securely hold a validator stake and participate in elections without a risk of stealing funds from it.

## What makes it different

Unlike standard wallets that allow transfers to any address, Restricted Wallet implements address-based restrictions that limit where funds can be sent.

**Standard wallet behavior:**\
You can send funds to any valid address.

**Restricted Wallet behavior:**\
You can only send funds to the predefined owner address or do operations with [Elector](/foundations/system#elector) (new stake, recover stake request, new complaint, and vote for a complaint) and [Config](/foundations/system#config) (vote for specific proposal to change config) contracts.

### Allowed actions

1. Send a message to the owner of this wallet.
1. Send "vote for a configuration proposal" message to the [Config contract](/foundations/system#config).
1. Send "new stake", "recover stake request", "new complaint", or "vote for a complaint" messages to the [Elector contract](/foundations/system#elector).

It is allowed to use [message modes](/languages/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) 128, 64, 2, and 1. Mode 2 (ignore errors) is always enabled when sending messages from this wallet.
