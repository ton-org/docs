Restricted Wallet is a specialized wallet contract that restricts transfers to predefined owner address, and some operations with Elector and Config contracts. It is used in [Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) project to securely hold a validator stake and participate in elections without a risk of stealing funds from it.

## What makes it different

Unlike standard wallets that allow transfers to any address, Restricted Wallet implements address-based restrictions that limit where funds can be sent.

**Standard wallet behavior:**\
You can send funds to any valid address.

**Restricted Wallet behavior:**\
You can only send funds to the predefined owner address or do operations with [Elector](https://beta-docs.ton.org/foundations/system-contracts#elector) (new stake, recover stake request, new complaint, and vote for a complaint) and [Config](/foundations/system-contracts#config) (vote for specific proposal to change config) contracts.

## How it works

### Address restriction mechanism

1. Predefined destination: The wallet is configured with a single allowed destination address
1. Transfer validation: All outgoing transfers are checked against the allowed address
1. Validation exception: Transfers to validation contracts are always allowed

## Single Nominator use case

The [Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) project demonstrates a practical implementation of Restricted Wallet for secure validation operations.

This implementation replaces the standard wallet with a restricted wallet that allows outgoing transactions only to restricted destinations such as the Elector contract and the owner's address.

### Architecture

### Implementation details

1. Cold wallet separation: Owner controls funds from an offline wallet
1. Restricted validator: Validator node can only interact with validation contracts
1. Fund protection: Only owner can withdraw funds; nominator contract handles staking
1. Emergency controls: Owner can change validator address if compromised
