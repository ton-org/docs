Restricted Wallet is a specialized wallet contract that restricts transfers to only one predefined destination address.

## What makes it different

Unlike standard wallets that allow transfers to any address, Restricted Wallet implements address-based restrictions that limit where funds can be sent.

**Standard wallet behavior:**\
You can send funds to any valid address.

**Restricted Wallet behavior:**\
You can only send funds to the predefined destination address (except for validation contracts).

## How it works

### Address restriction mechanism

1. Predefined destination: The wallet is configured with a single allowed destination address
2. Transfer validation: All outgoing transfers are checked against the allowed address
3. Validation exception: Transfers to validation contracts are always allowed

## Single Nominator use case

The [Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) project demonstrates a practical implementation of Restricted Wallet for secure validation operations.

This implementation replaces the standard wallet with a restricted wallet that allows outgoing transactions only to restricted destinations such as the Elector contract and the owner's address.

Restricted Wallet is unmaintained and has unresolved security issues. Use [Nominator Pool](/standard/nominator-pool) for new deployments.

### Architecture

### Implementation details

1. Cold wallet separation: Owner controls funds from an offline wallet
2. Restricted validator: Validator node can only interact with validation contracts
3. Fund protection: Only owner can withdraw funds; nominator contract handles staking
4. Emergency controls: Owner can change validator address if compromised
