  Gas costs can vary between different versions of TVM, keep that in mind.

This page provides comprehensive cost comparison for TON wallet contracts, presenting both gas consumption metrics and real-world costs in TON. The cost data includes all transaction fees, not just gas consumption, enabling users to make informed decisions based on their specific use cases.

## Batch transfers (200 messages)

V5 is still most effective, but difference is negligible.

| Wallet Version  | Gas (units) | Cost (TON) | Cost per message (TON) | Difference          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **V5**          | 147,622     | 0.1954632  | 0.000977               | Most cost-effective |

| **V4**          | 261,700     | 0.2485200  | 0.001243               | +27.14% vs V5       |

<Aside>
  Keep in mind that Highload V3 uses two transactions for batch transfers, which incur additional forward fee costs.
  Also, actual gas consumption may vary between runs because the contract must process the existing dictionary state, while in the sandbox, each run usually starts from a clean state.

## Methodology

### Sandbox measurements:

Framework: Blueprint + [@ton/sandbox](/contract-dev/testing/overview)

Wallets: implementations from [@ton/ton](https://github.com/ton-org/ton) (V3R2, V4, V5R1) and [Highload V3 sources](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/highload-wallet-contract-v3)

Test scenario: Transfer 0.01 TON with `PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY` mode with unique comment for each message in batches to prevent deduplication.

### On-chain measurements:

Network: TON testnet

Wallets: Same implementations as sandbox

Measurement: Actual transaction fees from explorer data
