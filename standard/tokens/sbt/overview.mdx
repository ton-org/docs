Soul-bound Tokens are non-transferable [NFTs](/standard/tokens/nft/overview).

## Why 
Soul-bound Tokens represent a revolutionary concept in digital identity and credential management within the TON blockchain. These tokens embody permanence and non-transferability, creating an immutable link between specific credentials and their holders' blockchain addresses. The term "soul-bound" references the permanent binding of these tokens to their recipient's account.

Everyone can be confident that each SBT has exactly one owner, enabling protocols to grant privileges to that owner via the SBT, which expands the protocol's capabilities.

The technical foundation of SBTs builds upon existing NFT infrastructure while implementing transfer restrictions. SBTs inherit the uniqueness and metadata capabilities of NFTs but incorporate smart contract logic that prevents transfer operations. This design ensures that tokens remain permanently bound to their original recipients while maintaining all the verification and authenticity benefits of blockchain technology.

The defining characteristic of SBTs lies in their non-transferable nature. Once issued to a specific address, these tokens cannot be moved, sold, or transferred to any other address.
