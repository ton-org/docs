This article describes the basic ideas and processes behind the implementation of Jettons (aka tokens in Ethereum) in the TON Blockchain.

## Related smart contracts

Standardized tokens on TON (see TEPs [0074](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md)
and [0089](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md)) are implemented using a set of
smart contracts, including:

- [Jetton master](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-minter.fc) (that is also called _Jetton minter_) smart contract;
- [Jetton wallet](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/blob/main/ft/jetton-wallet.fc) smart contract.

It is important to keep in mind that Jetton standards provide only a general scheme of interaction, leaving the specific implementation of related contracts to developers.

### Jetton master

_Jetton master_ smart contracts store general information about a particular jetton, such as total supply (the total number of tokens of this type),
a metadata link (or the metadata itself) and a code of the standard jetton-wallet smart contract for this jetton. They
also have an _owner (admin)_ who, by sending suitable messages to them, [mints new tokens](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-mint), closes the minting, change metadata or transfers the
admin rights to another contract.

Jetton master contracts also receive notifications about the [burning of tokens](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-burning).
When they receive such a notification, they must adjust the total supply accordingly.

### Jetton wallet

_Jetton wallet_ smart contracts are used to [transfer](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-transfer), receive, and [burn](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-burning) jettons. Each jetton wallet contract stores
wallet balance information for specific users (owner), address of Jetton master contract (for appropriate minting), and some additional information.
In certain cases, Jetton wallets are used for individual token holders for each token type.

### Difference between Jetton wallets and regular ones

Although both regular wallets and Jetton wallets are smart contracts, there are some significant differences between them.

The regular wallets smart contract are designed for off-chain interaction with their owner. In most implementations, their main purpose is to receive
external messages and perform the operations requested in them. It is through a regular
wallet that the user sends requests for the transfer of tokens or their burning to the Jetton wallet smart contract.
They are designed to store only the native TON Blockchain currency: toncoins or TONs.

On the other hand, Jetton wallets smart contracts are designed only for storing and processing tokens. They ignore any external messages and
accept only special internal ones. They execute commands received only from the Jetton master, another Jetton wallet or
their owner's regular wallet smart contracts.

## Message layouts

Interactions with Jetton contracts, which are most often encountered by users and developers, are:

- tokens transfer: sending tokens from one Jetton wallet to another;
- tokens minting: minting new tokens and transferring them to the Jetton wallet;
- tokens burning: burn a certain number of tokens on the Jetton wallet contract;
- wallet address providing: find the address of the Jetton wallet corresponding to a regular wallet.

<Warning>
  In all schemes below you will see the `query id` field. Nowadays the field is almost deprecated, and protocols itself doesn't need it.
  It is mostly used for easier off-chain parsing and other web2 processing.

### Token transfer

`Actor A regular wallet -> actor A Jetton wallet`. _Transfer_ message contains the following data:

| Name                   | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                            |

| `forward_ton_amount`   | VarUInteger 16    | Toncoins to forward to the recipient. Must `> 0` to send a transfer notification with `forward_payload` and must be less than the Toncoin attached to this message.    |

```

### Wallet address providing

This process is very simple. Some actor sends to the Jetton master contract `provide_wallet_address` message that contains the following fields:

| Name              | Type       | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query_id`        | uint64     | To ensure this process works correctly, **always use a unique query ID**.  |
| `owner_address`   | MsgAddress | The address of the actor which Jetton wallet address is needed.            |
| `include_address` | Bool       | Whether to include the address of the actor himself in the output message. |

Then, the Jetton master contract sends to the actor a message that contains the following fields:

| Name             | Type              | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query_id`       | uint64            | To ensure this process works correctly, **always use a unique query ID**. |
| `wallet_address` | MsgAddress        | The Jetton wallet contract address.                                       |
| `owner_address`  | Maybe ^MsgAddress | The address of the owner.                                                 |

These messages meet the corresponding TL-B schemes in [TEP 0089](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0089-jetton-wallet-discovery.md):

```tlb
provide_wallet_address#2c76b973 query_id:uint64 owner_address:MsgAddress
include_address:Bool = InternalMsgBody;

take_wallet_address#d1735400 query_id:uint64 wallet_address:MsgAddress
owner_address:(Maybe ^MsgAddress) = InternalMsgBody;
```

## Interaction from UI

There are three actions that can be performed through the UI:

- [getting wallet balance](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-get-wallet-data);
- [transfer jettons](/standard/tokens/jettons/how-to-transfer);
- indexing available jettons.

### Applications

The most popular user wallet applications, such as [TonKeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/), use their own SQL-like database. When the user receives new jetton for the first time,
the application processes the `transfer_notification` message. Next, information about the number of jettons received is taken from it and it is
checked if there is information about this jetton in the applications database. If there is, information is added to the database stating that the user has a
new type of jetton in the amount received. If not, the database starts indexing this new jetton and after the validation process begins to show data
about it to users. This is how all the jettons that a given user has and their amounts are listed.

In order for a user to transfer a given amount of a token to another user, they only need to fill in the `destination` and `amount`
fields through the application. Next, it will automatically generate a transfer message and send it to the jetton-wallet smart contract associated with the user.

### Web services

Various web services, such as [Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/), can also be used to obtain information about the types of user jettons and their amounts.
Unlike wallet applications, they also have the ability to directly invoke the get methods of related smart contracts.
However, they are not designed to generate and send messages.
