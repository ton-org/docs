## Introduction

Mintless jettons represent a revolutionary approach to token distribution on the TON blockchain. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for deploying mintless jettons, from initial setup to production deployment and ongoing maintenance.

<Aside>
  Before deploying a mintless jetton, ensure you understand the [basic concepts](/standard/tokens/jettons/mintless) and have experience with standard jetton deployment.
</Aside>

**Prerequisites**

Before starting the deployment process, ensure you have:

- A TON wallet with sufficient funds for deployment
- Understanding of Merkle trees and cryptographic proofs
- Access to hosting infrastructure for off-chain data
- List of airdrop recipients with their allocated amounts
- Development environment set up for TON smart contracts

## Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

Deploying a mintless jetton involves several critical steps:

### 1. Prepare the Merkle Tree

The foundation of any mintless jetton is a properly constructed Merkle tree containing all airdrop data.

#### Data Collection

- **Compile recipient list**: Gather all wallet addresses eligible for the airdrop
- **Determine allocations**: Assign token amounts to each recipient based on your distribution criteria
- **Set time constraints**: Define `start_from` and `expired_at` timestamps for claim availability

#### Tree Generation Process

```
AirdropItem Structure:
- amount: Coins (allocated tokens)
- start_from: uint48 (Unix timestamp for claim start)
- expired_at: uint48 (Unix timestamp for claim expiry)
```

- Generate a Merkle tree with all airdrop recipients and their respective amounts
- Each leaf contains an `AirdropItem` with amount, start time, and expiry
- Compute the root `merkle_hash` that will be stored on-chain

#### Best Practices

- **Validate addresses**: Ensure all recipient addresses are valid TON addresses
- **Check allocations**: Verify total allocation doesn't exceed intended supply
- **Test tree generation**: Use small datasets first to validate your tree construction process

### 2. Deploy the Jetton Master Contract

The jetton master contract must be extended to support mintless functionality.

#### Contract Requirements

- Include the `merkle_hash` in the contract's storage
- Implement the `get_mintless_airdrop_hashmap_root` get-method
- Ensure compatibility with [TEP-177](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/177) standard
- Use the [mintless jetton standard implementation](https://github.com/ton-community/mintless-jetton) as reference

#### Storage Extensions

```
Standard jetton storage + {
  merkle_hash: uint256  // Root hash of the Merkle tree
}
```

#### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Contract includes merkle\_hash in storage
- [ ] All standard jetton methods are implemented
- [ ] Mintless-specific get-methods are available
- [ ] Contract has been thoroughly tested
- [ ] Deployment transaction has sufficient gas

### 3. Set Up Off-Chain Infrastructure

Mintless jettons require robust off-chain infrastructure to serve Merkle proofs and tree data.

#### Merkle Tree Hosting

- **Storage options**: TON Storage, IPFS, AWS S3, or other reliable hosting
- **File format**: Store complete tree as BoC (Bag of Cells) file
- **Accessibility**: Ensure high availability and fast access times
- **Redundancy**: Consider multiple hosting locations for reliability

#### Custom Payload API Implementation

Implement an API endpoint that provides:

- Individual Merkle proofs for specific addresses
- Initialization data for jetton wallet deployment
- Verification of claim eligibility

**API Endpoints:**

```
GET /api/v1/proof/{address}
Response: {
  "proof": "base64_encoded_merkle_proof",
  "init_data": "base64_encoded_init_data",
  "amount": "1000000000",
  "start_from": 1699123200,
  "expired_at": 1699209600
}
```

#### Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement aggressive caching for frequently requested proofs
- **Load balancing**: Use CDN or load balancers for high-traffic scenarios
- **Rate limiting**: Protect against abuse while ensuring legitimate access

### 4. Configure Metadata

Update your jetton's metadata to include mintless-specific fields.

#### Required Metadata Fields

According to the [metadata standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md):

```json
{
  "name": "Your Mintless Token",
  "symbol": "YMT",
  "decimals": "9",
  "description": "Description of your token",
  "image": "https://example.com/token-logo.png",
  "mintless_merkle_dump_uri": "https://example.com/merkle-tree.boc",
  "custom_payload_api_uri": "https://example.com/api/v1/"
}
```

#### Key Considerations

- **mintless\_merkle\_dump\_uri**: Direct link to the complete Merkle tree data
- **custom\_payload\_api\_uri**: Base URL for the custom payload API
- **Hosting reliability**: Ensure these URIs remain accessible long-term
- **HTTPS requirement**: Use secure connections for all external resources

## Development Tools and Utilities

Several specialized tools can assist with mintless jetton development and auditing.

### mintless-proof-generator (TON Core)

Official utility from the TON blockchain core team for Merkle proof generation and verification.

#### Installation

1. **Clone and build**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton
cd ton
git checkout testnet
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make mintless-proof-generator
```

The compiled utility is located at `build/crypto/mintless-proof-generator`.

#### Usage

**Parse and verify Merkle tree:**

```bash
build/crypto/mintless-proof-generator parse <input-boc> <output-file>
```

This command:

- Prints the mintless Merkle dump cell hash
- Stores the airdrop list in `<output-file>`
- Format: `<address> <amount> <start_from> <expired_at>` (one per line)

**Generate all Merkle proofs:**

```bash
build/crypto/mintless-proof-generator make_all_proofs <input-boc> <output-file>
```

Use this for creating the complete proof set needed for `custom_payload_api_uri`.

### mintless-toolbox (Tonkeeper)

Community-developed utility from the Tonkeeper team with additional features.

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonkeeper/mintless-toolbox.git
cd mintless-toolbox
make
```

#### Usage

**Dump airdrop data:**

```bash
./bin/mintless-cli dump <airdrop-filename>
```

This utility:

- Reads airdrop files in various formats
- Outputs data in CSV format: `address,amount,start_from,expired_at`
- Provides additional validation and formatting options
