## Introduction

<Aside>
  To understand this document, you should be familiar with the other basic Jetton standards.
</Aside>

TON has introduced [Mintless Jettons](https://github.com/ton-community/mintless-jetton?tab=readme-ov-file), an innovative extension of the Jetton standard.

Mintless extension adopts [Merkle proofs](/foundations/proofs/overview), using them to make airdrops without requiring traditional minting processes.

In this article, we will explore how mintless jettons work and how to use them.

## Overview

Mintless jettons are an extension ([TEP-177](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/177) and [TEP-176](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/176)) of the standard Jetton implementation ([TEP-74](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md)) on TON Blockchain.

This implementation enables large-scale, decentralized airdrops to millions of users while minimizing costs and blockchain load.

Note that to use a mintless jetton to its full extent, you will need to establish an off-chain architecture.

### Basic features

- **Scalability**: Traditional minting processes can be resource-intensive and costly when distributing tokens to a vast number of users.
- **Efficiency**: By utilizing Merkle trees, mintless jettons store a single hash representing all airdropped amounts, reducing storage requirements.
- **User-friendly airdrops**: No separate pre-claim: wallets attach a Merkle proof on first transfer, so users don't perform a manual claim action.

Because mintless jettons extend the standard jettons, you can interact with them the same way as standard jettons — no additional steps required.

## How it works

Mintless jettons leverage [Merkle trees](/foundations/proofs/overview) and cryptographic proofs to enable efficient, decentralized airdrops without traditional minting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the technical implementation:

### Merkle Tree Foundation

The core innovation lies in representing all airdrop data as a single Merkle tree, where:

- **Leaf nodes** contain airdrop information for individual addresses
- **Internal nodes** store cryptographic hashes of their children
- **Root hash** represents the entire airdrop dataset with a single 256-bit value

This approach reduces storage from O(n) per recipient to O(1) for the entire airdrop.

### Data Structures

Airdrop HashMap represents how we store individual users' airdrop information.

```tlb
_ amount:Coins start_from:uint48 expired_at:uint48 = AirdropItem;

_ _(HashMap 267 AirdropItem) = Airdrop;
```

Each airdrop entry contains:

- `amount`: Number of tokens allocated to the recipient
- `start_from`: Unix timestamp when claiming becomes available
- `expired_at`: Unix timestamp when claiming expires

The complete airdrop is stored as a HashMap where the key is a 267-bit internal TON account address and the value is an AirdropItem structure.

For the Jetton Master contract, standard storage is extended with `merkle_hash`: 256-bit root hash of the Merkle tree containing all airdrop data.

The standard wallet storage is extended with:

- `merkle_hash`: Copy of the master's Merkle hash for validation
- `already_claimed`: Boolean flag indicating whether the airdrop has been claimed

### Claiming Mechanism

```tlb
merkle_airdrop_claim#0df602d6 proof:^Cell = CustomPayload;
```

The claiming process uses the `custom_payload` field in standard jetton transfers with:

- `0x0df602d6`: Operation identifier for Merkle airdrop claims
- `proof`: MerkleProof exotic cell containing the cryptographic proof

```tlb
transfer#0f8a7ea5 query_id:uint64 amount:(VarUInteger 16) destination:MsgAddress
                 response_destination:MsgAddress custom_payload:(Maybe ^Cell)
                 forward_ton_amount:(VarUInteger 16) forward_payload:(Either Cell ^Cell)
                 = InternalMsgBody;
```

The standard transfer message is enhanced by including the claim proof in `custom_payload`.

### Cryptographic Proof Validation

When a jetton wallet receives a transfer with a claim payload, it performs these validation steps:

1. Merkle Proof Verification

- Extracts the MerkleProof exotic cell from `custom_payload`
- Verifies the proof's cryptographic integrity against the stored `merkle_hash`
- Ensures the proof path leads to a valid `AirdropItem` for the sender's address

2. Timestamp Validation

- Checks that `now() >= start_from` (claiming period has begun)
- Verifies that `now() <= expired_at` (claiming period hasn't expired)

3. Claim Status Check

- Ensures `already_claimed == false` (prevents double-claiming)

4. Amount Validation

- Extracts the airdrop amount from the validated AirdropItem
- Credits this amount to the wallet's balance

### State Transitions

Before Claim:

```
JettonWallet {
  balance: 0,
  already_claimed: false,
  merkle_hash: <root_hash>
}
```

After Successful Claim:

```
JettonWallet {
  balance: <airdrop_amount>,
  already_claimed: true,
  merkle_hash: <root_hash>
}
```

### Off-chain Infrastructure

#### Merkle Tree Generation

1. **Data Collection**: Gather all recipient addresses and their allocated amounts
1. **Tree Construction**: Build a binary Merkle tree with AirdropItem structures as leaves
1. **Hash Computation**: Calculate SHA-256 hashes recursively up to the root
1. **Proof Generation**: Create individual Merkle proofs for each recipient

#### Proof Serving

- **Static Storage**: Host the complete Merkle tree data at `mintless_merkle_dump_uri`
- **Dynamic API**: Implement `custom_payload_api_uri` to serve individual proofs on demand
- **Caching**: Optimize proof retrieval with appropriate caching strategies

## Supporting mintless jettons in wallet applications

Wallet applications play a key role in improving the user experience with mintless jettons:

- **Display unclaimed jettons**: Wallets should show users the jettons they are eligible to claim based on the Merkle tree data.
- **Automated claim process**: When users initiate an outgoing transfer, wallets should automatically include the necessary Merkle proof in the transfer message's custom payload.

Wallets can achieve this by:

Integrating with the off-chain API specified in the [custom payload API](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0064-token-data-standard.md#jetton-metadata-example-offchain):

- Check if the jetton is mintless.
- Verify whether the wallet owner has claimed it.
- If unclaimed, retrieve data from the custom payload API and add the off-chain balance to the on-chain one.
- If the user hasn’t claimed the airdrop, retrieve the custom payload and initialization data from the Custom Payload API and include it in the `transfer` message to the Jetton wallet.

Using a custom API:

- Download the airdrop tree from `mintless_merkle_dump_uri` in the jetton metadata.
- Parse the data as explained in [Merkle tree generation](#merkle-tree-generation).
- Make the parsed result available via API.

<Aside>
  Wallets are not required to support mintless claims, including indexing airdrop trees. Wallet applications may charge the jetton issuer for this service.

## Supporting mintless jettons in DApps (DEX/Lending platforms)

Because wallet applications handle claims automatically, DApps don’t need special logic for mintless jettons. DApps can use APIs (such as TonAPI or Ton Center API) to display unclaimed balances.

To improve the user experience, DApps can check if the user's wallet application supports a specific mintless jetton. If unsupported, retrieve the airdrop proof and initialization data from the Jetton API and include it in the transfer message.
