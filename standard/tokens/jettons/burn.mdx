Burning is a process of reducing supply of a certain Jetton, mostly in order to create [deflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation).

## Web services

To burn Jettons manually, use a web service, for example [Minter](https://minter.ton.org/):

- Connect your wallet using TON Connect.
- Enter the Jetton master contract address into the "Jetton address" field.
- Click the "Burn" button in your wallet's balance field and enter the amount you want to burn.
- Confirm burning in your wallet application.

## Another approach

An alternative way to burn tokens is to send them to a ["zero" account](https://tonviewer.com/UQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJKZ), see [How to transfer](/standard/tokens/jettons/transfer) page. A [wallet app](/ecosystem/wallet-apps/overview) can be used for this.

## Programmatically

In more complex cases, it is usually done with an SDK (for example, [`assets-sdk`](https://github.com/ton-community/assets-sdk)) that handles low-level message serialization details. The provided example uses [TON Center API](/ecosystem/api/toncenter/overview). You'll need a mnemonic of a wallet that will pay for the burn. `JETTON_WALLET_ADDR` stands for the Jetton wallet that holds tokens that will be burned.

  Beware that API keys and mnemonic must not be committed or shared publicly.

  A better approach is to use a `.env` file that is excluded from repository with `.gitignore`. For Github CI purposes, consult [their documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets).

    const keyPair = await mnemonicToPrivateKey(MNEMONIC.split(" "));

    // create a client for TON wallet
    const wallet = WalletContractV5R1.create({
        workchain: 0,
        // public key is required to deploy a new wallet
        // if it wasn't deployed yet
        publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    });

    const provider = client.provider(wallet.address);

    // sender is an object used by assets-sdk to send messages
    // private key is used to sign messages sent to a wallet
    const sender = wallet.sender(provider, keyPair.secretKey);

    // create an assets-sdk client 
    const api = await createApi(NETWORK);
    const sdk = AssetsSDK.create({
        api,
        sender,
    });

    // create a client for interacting with given jetton wallet
    const jetton = sdk.openJettonWallet(JETTON_WALLET_ADDR);

    // burn 1200000 jettons
    await jetton.sendBurn(sender, 1200000n);
}

void main();
