title: "How to find Jetton wallet"
---

Some application may want to be able to discover their or other contract wallets for some specific Jetton Master.
For instance some contract may want to obtain and store its jetton wallet for some Jetton to handle transfer notifications from it in specific way.

To compute the address of a Jetton wallet from the address of its owner (a regular user wallet),
the Jetton master contract provides the `get_wallet_address (slice owner_address)` method.

```typescript
import { TonClient, Address, beginCell, TupleItemSlice } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
  });
  const jettonMasterAddress = Address.parse(
    "put the Jetton master address in any format",
  );
  const walletAddress = Address.parse("put owner's address in any format");
  const walletAddressCell = beginCell().storeAddress(walletAddress).endCell();
  // forming the required type for the stack
  const el: TupleItemSlice = {
    type: "slice",
    cell: walletAddressCell,
  };
  // call the get method with a non-empty stack
  const data = await client.runMethod(
    jettonMasterAddress,
    "get_wallet_address",
    [el],
  );
  // get the Jetton wallet address
  console.log(data.stack.readAddress());
}

void main();
```

Or if you are sure about structure of Jetton wallet's initial persistent storage and know its code, you
can also manually create `StateInit` of the Jetton wallet and thus calculate its address.
<Warning>
Use this method with great care, as the c4 of Jetton wallet contracts is not specified.
</Warning>


```typescript
import {
  Address,
  Cell,
  beginCell,
  contractAddress,
  StateInit,
} from "@ton/core";

// let's choose Thether USDT as an example

const jettonwalletcode = Cell.fromHex(
  "b5ee9c72010101010023000842028f452d7a4dfd74066b682365177259ed05734435be76b5fd4bd5d8af2b7c3d68",
);

const masterAddress = Address.parse(
  "0:b113a994b5024a16719f69139328eb759596c38a25f59028b146fecdc3621dfe",
);
const ownerAddress = Address.parse("an address in any format");
const jettonwalletdata = beginCell()
  .storeAddress(ownerAddress)
  .storeAddress(masterAddress)
  .storeVarUint(0, 16) // the initial value is always zero
  .endCell();

const jettonWalletStateInit: StateInit = {
  code: jettonwalletcode,
  data: jettonwalletdata,
};

const BASECHAIN = 0; // All Jetton wallet contracts are located in Basechain by default
const jettonWalletAddress = contractAddress(BASECHAIN, jettonWalletStateInit);

console.log(jettonWalletAddress.toString());
```

There are also various web services that allow you to call contract's get methods without writing any code.
For example, let's inspect the [Tether USD](https://tonviewer.com/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs?section=method) master
contract page on Tonviewer. Inserting owner's address in any format and executing the get method, you obtain the Jetton wallet address.

Finally, you can use [built-in APIs](/ecosystem/rpc/toncenter).
