title: "How to find Jetton wallet"
---

Some applications may want to be able to discover their own or other contract wallets for a specific Jetton Master.
For instance, some contracts may want to obtain and store their Jetton wallet for Jetton to handle transfer notifications from it in a specific way.

To compute the address of a Jetton wallet from the address of its owner (a regular user wallet),
the Jetton master contract provides the `get_wallet_address (slice owner_address)` method.

```typescript
import { TonClient, Address, beginCell, TupleItemSlice } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
  });
  const jettonMasterAddress = Address.parse(
    "put the Jetton master address in any format",
  );
  const walletAddress = Address.parse("put owner's address in any format");
  const walletAddressCell = beginCell().storeAddress(walletAddress).endCell();
  // forming the required type for the stack
  const el: TupleItemSlice = {
    type: "slice",
    cell: walletAddressCell,
  };
  // call the get method with a non-empty stack
  const data = await client.runMethod(
    jettonMasterAddress,
    "get_wallet_address",
    [el],
  );
  // get the Jetton wallet address
  console.log(data.stack.readAddress());
}

void main();
```

Or if you are sure about the structure of Jetton wallet's initial persistent storage and know its code, you
can also manually create `StateInit` of the Jetton wallet and thus calculate its address.

<Warning>
  Use this method with great care, as the c4 of Jetton wallet contracts is not specified.
</Warning>

```typescript
import {
  Address,
  Cell,
  beginCell,
  contractAddress,
  StateInit,
} from "@ton/core";

// let's choose Tether USDT as an example

const jettonwalletcode = Cell.fromHex(
  "b5ee9c72010101010023000842028f452d7a4dfd74066b682365177259ed05734435be76b5fd4bd5d8af2b7c3d68",
);

const masterAddress = Address.parse(
  "0:b113a994b5024a16719f69139328eb759596c38a25f59028b146fecdc3621dfe",
);
const ownerAddress = Address.parse("an address in any format");
const jettonwalletdata = beginCell()
  .storeAddress(ownerAddress)
  .storeAddress(masterAddress)
  .storeVarUint(0, 16) // the initial value is always zero
  .endCell();

const jettonWalletStateInit: StateInit = {
  code: jettonwalletcode,
  data: jettonwalletdata,
};

const BASECHAIN = 0; // All Jetton wallet contracts are located in Basechain by default
const jettonWalletAddress = contractAddress(BASECHAIN, jettonWalletStateInit);

console.log(jettonWalletAddress.toString());
```

There are also various web services that allow you to call contract's get methods without writing any code.
For example, let's inspect the [Tether USD](https://tonviewer.com/EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs?section=method) master
contract page on Tonviewer. Inserting the owner's address in any format and executing the get method, you obtain the Jetton wallet address.

Finally, you can use [built-in APIs](/ecosystem/rpc/toncenter).
