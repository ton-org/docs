Jettons (TEP-74 standard) serve as TON's counterpart to Ethereum's [ERC-20 tokens](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), functioning as the primary means of representing monetary value and fungible assets within the TON ecosystem. These tokens embody the principle of fungibility, where each unit holds identical value and can be seamlessly exchanged with any other unit of the same token type.

Use cases:

- To represent currency on-chain, like USDT. Each Jetton can be arbitrary fraction (1 Jetton = 10<sup>-6</sup> USD)
- To empower governance-like voting systems. Each Jetton equals a vote
- To represent deposit size in Decentralized Finance

The technical architecture of Jettons reflects TON's distributed design principles. Rather than storing all token information in a single contract, the system employs a distributed approach where each user maintains their own Jetton wallet contract. The main Jetton contract functions as a central registry, storing essential metadata and tracking total supply, while individual wallet contracts handle user-specific balances and execute transfer operations. This architecture enhances scalability and reduces congestion compared to centralized token models.
