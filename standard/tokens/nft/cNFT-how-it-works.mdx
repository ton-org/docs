## What a cNFT is

A cNFT (compressed non‑fungible token) combines a [standard NFT](/standard/tokens/nft/overview) with an [airdrop distribution](/standard/tokens/airdrop). It shifts most deployment and minting costs from the collection owner to end users, which helps when a collection targets a large audience.

## How it differs from a standard NFT

1. The [collection contract](/standard/tokens/nft/how-works) pre‑commits future owners by storing a Merkle root for the allowlist. You can read it via the get method `get_merkle_root` (see [Merkle proofs](/ton/proofs/merkle)).
1. Any user can deploy NFT item by sending the deploy message with a valid Merkle proof. The collection accepts a deploy from any sender as long as the proof matches the stored root.
