Stub

The creator sends a message to the collection contract, which then deploys a new NFT item with the specified data (initial owner and item‑specific content). The standard does not prescribe exactly how these data must be supplied; typically the creator provides the initial owner and item‑specific content for each NFT, or this information is derived from the collection itself (see [cNFT](/standard/tokens/nft/cNFT-how-it-works)).
