<Stub issue="586" />

The creator sends a message to the collection contract, which deploys a new NFT item with the specified data (initial owner and item‑specific content). The standard does not prescribe exactly how this data must be supplied. Typically, the creator provides the initial owner and item‑specific content for each NFT, or this information is derived from the collection itself (see [cNFT](/standard/tokens/nft/cNFT-how-it-works)).
