NFT transfer is an operation specified in [TEP 0062](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/1fbc23cac69723c53251f686ec90d81bf0e83443/text/0062-nft-standard.md), see also [here](/standard/tokens/nft/how-it-works#transfer-nft-item). Its implementation must comply with this standard, and NFT item contracts must support the logic described there. The NFT transfer message is also specified and must comply with the corresponding TL-B scheme. This scheme involves, among other things,

- `forward_amount`: the amount of nanotons to be sent to the destination address;
- `forward_payload`: optional custom data that should be sent to the destination address.

`forward_payload` must comply with one of the [standard formats](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/1fbc23cac69723c53251f686ec90d81bf0e83443/text/0062-nft-standard.md#forward_payload-format).

Use a wallet app that supports NFTs (for example, [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.helpscoutdocs.com/article/47-how-to-send-nft-to-another-wallet)) and follow its guide. Alternatively, perform the transfer manually. The example below illustrates a programmatic transfer:

```typescript
import { WalletContractV5R1, TonClient, Address, toNano } from "@ton/ton";

import { mnemonicToPrivateKey } from "@ton/crypto";

import { AssetsSDK, createApi } from "@ton-community/assets-sdk";

async function main() {
    const client = new TonClient({
        endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
    });

    const MNEMONIC = process.env.MNEMONIC as string; // set via environment
    const keyPair = await mnemonicToPrivateKey(MNEMONIC.split(" "));

    const wallet = WalletContractV5R1.create({
        workchain: 0,
        publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    });

    const provider = client.provider(wallet.address);
    const sender = wallet.sender(provider, keyPair.secretKey);

    const NETWORK = "testnet";
    const api = await createApi(NETWORK);

    const sdk = AssetsSDK.create({
        api,
        sender,
    });

    // "<NFT_ITEM_ADDR>" and "<RECEIVER_ADDR>" should be replaced with its actual addresses
    const NFT_ADDRESS = Address.parse("<NFT_ITEM_ADDR>");
    const nftItem = await sdk.openNftItem(NFT_ADDRESS);

    const RECEIVER_ADDRESS = Address.parse("<RECEIVER_ADDR>");
    await nftItem.send(sender, RECEIVER_ADDRESS, { value: toNano(10) });
}

void main();
```
