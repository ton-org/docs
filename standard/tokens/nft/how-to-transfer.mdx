NFT transfer is an operation specified in [TEP 0062](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md). Its implementation must comply with this standard,
and NFT item contracts must support the logic described there. The NFT transfer message is
also specified and must comply with the corresponding TL-B scheme. This scheme involves, among other things,

- `forward_amount`: the amount of nanotons to be sent to the destination address;
- `forward_payload`: optional custom data that should be sent to the destination address.

If `forward_amount > 0`, then `forward_payload` must comply with one of the [standard formats](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md#forward_payload-format).

First, you can use your wallet app with NFTs, just follow the corresponding guides (see [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.helpscoutdocs.com/article/47-how-to-send-nft-to-another-wallet) for an instance).
Or you can do it manually. Below there is an illustrative example:

```typescript
import { WalletContractV5R1, TonClient, Address, toNano } from "@ton/ton";

import { mnemonicToPrivateKey } from "@ton/crypto";

import { AssetsSDK, createApi } from "@ton-community/assets-sdk";

async function main() {
    const client = new TonClient({
        endpoint: "https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC",
    });

    const MNEMONIC = process.env.MNEMONIC as string; // set via environment
    const keyPair = await mnemonicToPrivateKey(MNEMONIC.split(" "));

    const wallet = WalletContractV5R1.create({
        workchain: 0,
        publicKey: keyPair.publicKey,
    });

    const provider = client.provider(wallet.address);
    const sender = wallet.sender(provider, keyPair.secretKey);

    const NETWORK = "testnet";
    const api = await createApi(NETWORK);

    const sdk = AssetsSDK.create({
        api,
        sender,
    });

    const NFT_ADDRESS = Address.parse("put your NFT item address");
    const nftItem = await sdk.openNftItem(NFT_ADDRESS);

    const RECEIVER_ADDRESS = Address.parse("put receiver address");
    await nftItem.send(sender, RECEIVER_ADDRESS, { value: toNano(10) });
}

void main();
```
