## Built-ins

This section covers extra language constructs that are not part of the core but are still important for functionality.
Although they could be implemented in [stdlib.fc](/languages/func/stdlib),
keeping them as built-in features allows the FunC optimizer to work more efficiently.

In addition, FunC does not allow the built-in names in this section to be used as identifiers.
However, there is an exception: [built-ins with non-symbolic names](#built-ins-with-non-symbolic-names) 
*can* be used as identifiers for local variables.

### Built-ins with symbolic names

`_+_` &emsp; `_-_` &emsp; `-_` &emsp; `_*_`
 
`_/_` &emsp; `_~/_` &emsp; `_^/_` &emsp; `_%_`

`_~%_` &emsp; `_^%_` &emsp; `_/%_` &emsp; `_<<_`

`_>>_` &emsp; `_~>>_` &emsp; `_^>>_` &emsp; `_&_`

`_|_` &emsp; `_^_` &emsp; `~_` &emsp; `^_+=_`

`^_-=_` &emsp; `^_*=_` &emsp; `^_/=_` &emsp; `^_~/=_`

`^_^/=_` &emsp; `^_%=_` &emsp; `^_~%=_` &emsp; `^_^%=_`

`^_<<=_` &emsp; `^_>>=_` &emsp; `^_~>>=_` &emsp; `^_^>>=_`

`^_&=_` &emsp; `^_|=_` &emsp; `^_^=_` &emsp; `_==_`

`_!=_` &emsp; `_<_` &emsp; `_>_` &emsp; `_<=_`

`_>=_` &emsp; `_<=>_`

<Aside type="danger">
   The description of each of these built-ins must be specified, together with an example of usage.
</Aside>

#### `throw`

`throw` emits an unconditional exception. `throw` takes only one argument—the error code—since it always triggers an exception.

#### `throw_if`

`throw_if` emits an exception only if the provided condition is true. It receives two arguments: the error code, which defines the exception type, and 
the condition.

#### `throw_unless`

`throw_unless` emits an exception only if the provided condition is false. It receives two arguments: the error code, which defines the exception type, and 
the condition.

#### `throw_arg`

`throw_arg` is an unconditional exception with a parameter. It is the parameterized version of `throw`.
The first argument is a parameter of any type, the second argument defines the error code, and the third argument is the condition.

#### `throw_arg_if`

Parameterized version of `throw_if`.
The first argument is a parameter of any type, the second argument defines the error code, and the third argument is the condition.

#### `throw_arg_unless`

Parameterized version of `throw_unless`.
The first argument is a parameter of any type, the second argument defines the error code, and the third argument is the condition.

#### `~dump`

`~dump` outputs a variable to the debug log.

#### `~strdump`

`~strdump` outputs a string to the debug log.

#### `divmod`

`divmod` takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient and remainder of their division.

#### `muldiv`

`muldiv` performs a multiply-then-divide operation.
It uses a 513-bit intermediate result to prevent overflow if the final result fits within 257 bits.

#### `true`

`true` is an alias for `-1`.

#### `false`

`false` is an alias for `0`.

#### `null?`

`null?` checks if the given argument is `null`. In FunC, the value `null` belongs to the TVM type `Null`, which represents the absence of a value for certain atomic types. 
See [null values](/languages/func/types#null-values) for details.

#### `touch` and `~touch`

`touch` pushes a variable to the top of the stack. `~touch` is identical to `touch`, but it is adapted for use in [modifying syntax](/languages/func/functions#modifying-methods). 

<Aside type="danger">
   Link for modifying syntax is missing.
</Aside>

#### `at` 

Function `at` returns the value of a tuple element at the specified position.
