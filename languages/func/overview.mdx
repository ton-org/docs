<Aside>
  TON Blockchain uses [Tolk](/languages/tolk) as the official language. Other languages are still available, and legacy codebases exist, but Tolk is the only actively supported language. The FunC compiler, for instance, is no longer maintained.
</Aside>

FunC is a domain-specific, statically typed language with C-like syntax designed to write smart contracts on TON. It can be characterized as an intermediate-level language sitting on top of the [Fift](/languages/fift) assembly language.

Example of a FunC function for sending funds:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        ;; Set the message to be non-bounceable
        .store_uint(0x10, 6)
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

where

- [`()`](/languages/func/types#tensor-types) is the return type, that stands for "do not return value", similar to `void` in C;
- `send_money` is the name of the function;
- `slice address` is the first parameter, address to send money to; it's type is [`slice`](/languages/func/types#atomic-types);
- `int amount` is the second parameter, amount to be sent; it's type is [`int`](/languages/func/types#atomic-types);
- `impure inline` are [specifiers](/languages/func/functions#specifiers), which are flags that tell the compiler to process the method in a specific way;
- `var msg = ...` defines a variable without specifying its type; it will hold a [cell](/foundations/serialization/cells) with a [message](/foundations/messages/overview);
- [`begin_cell()`](/languages/func/stdlib#begin-cell) creates a [cell builder](/tvm/builders-and-slices);
- [`store_uint`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-uint), [`store_slice`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-slice), [`store_coins`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-coins) methods store data into the builder:
  - [flags](/foundations/messages/internal);
  - receiving address;
  - amount on Toncoin to attach to the message.
- [`.end_cell()`](/languages/func/stdlib#end-cell) method finalizes the builder and turns it into a cell;
- [`send_raw_message`](/languages/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) function sends the message, where the parameter `64` describes a [sending mode](/foundations/messages/internal).

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into [Fift](/languages/fift) assembly code. The Fift assembly code is then compiled down to the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm/overview) bitcode by the [Fift](/languages/fift) compiler.

Developers can use the compiled bitcode, structured as a [bag of cells](/foundations/serialization/boc) like all data in the TON blockchain, to test smart contracts, send messages, or execute it in a local TVM instance.

### End-to-end tooling

The easiest way to install the FunC compiler is the [`@ton-community/func-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-community/func-js) NPM package. It requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v22 or later.

The package has both the FunC and [Fift](/languages/fift) compilers, and produces bitcode directly from the FunC source code, without manually invoking Fift.

To install it, run the following command in the project root folder:

```bash
npm i @ton-community/func-js
```

Then, to compile a specific FunC file, run the following command:

```bash
npx func-js ./contract.fc --boc ./output.boc
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC source file in the project root, and `output.boc` is the compiled bitcode output.

FunC standard library is supplied separately from the language. Download `smartcont_lib.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases), extract it, and copy `stdlib.fc` to the project root.

Alternatively, use the [Blueprint](/contract-dev/blueprint/overview) to start a project pre-configured for development in FunC.

### Compile manually using the binaries

Prebuilt FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or ARM64), and Ubuntu are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases).

1. Download the corresponding binary for operating system:

   - Linux: `func-linux-x86_64` (Intel/AMD) and `func-linux-arm64` (ARM64)
   - Mac: `func-mac-x86-64` (Intel/AMD) and `func-mac-arm64` (ARM64)
   - Windows: `func.exe`

   Rename the executable, for example, to `func`, for easier use on the command line, and add it to system's `PATH`.

1. Download the FunC standard library.

   Get the `smartcont_lib.zip` from the same [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07), extract it, and copy `stdlib.fc` to project root.

1. Compile a FunC file to Fift assembly code.

   Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
func contract.fc -o output.fif
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC file to compile, and `output.fif` is the generated Fift output.

To compile the generated Fift file `output.fif` further down to TVM bitcode, use the Fift compiler. See the [Fift](/languages/fift) for download and usage instructions.

<Aside>
  The last FunC compiler version is v2025.07. The FunC compiler is no longer developed. New releases are focused on the [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) compiler.
