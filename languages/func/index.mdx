<Aside>
  The official language of TON Blockchain is Tolk. Other languages are still used, and legacy codebases exist, but Tolk is the only language actively supported. The FunC compiler, for instance, is no longer maintained.
</Aside>

**FunC** is an intermediate-level language used to write smart contracts on TON. It is a domain-specific, statically typed language with C-like syntax.
Example of a FunC method for sending funds:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The method receives two parameters: the [`address`](/foundations/addresses/overview) to send the money to,
and the `amount` to send. It does not return a value, indicated by [`()`](/languages/func/types#tensor-types) to the left of the method name `send_money`.

The method uses the `impure` and `inline` [specifiers](/languages/func/functions#specifiers), which are flags that tell the compiler to process
the method in specific ways.

The method first creates the [message](/foundations/transaction) to send `msg` by using a [cell builder](/tvm/builders-and-slices), since the message is encoded as a [cell](/tvm/serialization/cells). The procedure is:

1. Create a new cell builder with [`begin_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#begin-cell).
1. Set [message flags](/foundations/messages/internal), indicated at the line with the single-line [comment](/languages/func/comments) `;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.`.
1. Store the receiving address with [`store_slice`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-slice).
1. Store the amount to send using [`store_coins`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-coins).
1. Finalize the cell with a call to the [`end_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#end-cell) function.

Finally, function [`send_raw_message`](/languages/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) sends the message, where the parameter `64` describes a [sending mode](/foundations/messages/internal).

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into [Fift](/languages/fift) assembler code. The Fift assembler code is then compiled down to 
bitcode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm/overview) using the [Fift](/languages/fift) compiler.

Developers can use its bitcode, structured as a [bag of cells](/tvm/serialization/boc) like all data in the TON blockchain, to test smart contracts, send messages, or execute it in a local TVM instance.

### Compile using tooling

Assuming [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is already installed, the quickest way to compile FunC files down to bitcode is to install the 
NPM package `func-js` in your project folder. The `func-js` package puts together the FunC and [Fift](/languages/fift) compilers, so that there is no 
need to manually invoke the Fift compiler in order to produce bitcode directly from FunC source code.

To install `func-js`, execute the following command at the root of your project folder:

```bash
npm i @ton-community/func-js
```

Then, to compile a specific FunC file, run the command:

```bash
npx func-js ./contract.fc --boc ./output.boc
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC file to compile at the root of your project folder, 
and `output.boc` is the output file containing the compiled bitcode.

<Aside>
  It is recommended to copy the FunC Standard Library file to the root of your project folder. To do so,
  download the `smartcont_lib.zip` file from the [Github repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07). 
  Unzip it and copy the `stdlib.fc` file to the root of your project folder.
</Aside>

It is also possible to use Blueprint to start a project. Read more in the [Blueprint](/ecosystem/blueprint/overview) section for set up instructions.

### Compile manually using the binaries

FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07).
Follow these steps to download the FunC compiler from the Github repository:

1. Download the corresponding binary for your operating system:

   - Linux: `func-linux-x86_64` for Intel or AMD architecture and `func-linux-arm64` for Arm64.
   - Mac: `func-mac-x86-64` for Intel or AMD architecture and `func-mac-arm64` for Arm64.
   - Windows: `func.exe`.

   Rename the executable, for example to `func`, so that it easier to refer to it in the command line. Add the executable to 
   your path environment variable.

2. Download the `smartcont_lib.zip` file. Unzip it and copy the `stdlib.fc` to the root of your project folder. This file is the standard FunC library.

To compile a FunC file to [Fift](/languages/fift) assembler code, execute this command at the root of your project folder:

```bash 
func contract.fc -o output.fif
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC file to compile, and `output.fif` is the output file containing the generated Fift code.

If you need to compile the Fift file `output.fif` further down to TVM bitcode, you will need to use the Fift compiler. 
Refer to the [Fift](/languages/fift) section for information on how to download and execute the Fift compiler.

<Aside>
  The last version for the FunC compiler was v2025.07. The FunC compiler is no longer developed. New releases are focused on the [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) compiler.
