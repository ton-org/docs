<Aside>
  The official language of TON Blockchain is Tolk. Other languages are still used, and legacy codebases exist, but Tolk is the only language actively supported. The FunC compiler, for instance, is no longer maintained.
</Aside>

**FunC** is an intermediate-level language used to write smart contracts on TON. It is a domain-specific, statically typed language with C-like syntax.
Example of a FunC method for sending funds:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The method receives two parameters: the [`address`](/foundations/addresses/overview) to send the money to,
and the `amount` to send. It does not return a value, indicated by [`()`](/languages/func/types#tensor-types) to the left of the method name `send_money`.

The method uses the `impure` and `inline` [specifiers](/languages/func/functions#specifiers), which are flags that tell the compiler to process
the method in specific ways.

The method first creates the [message](/foundations/transaction) to send `msg` by using a [cell builder](), since the message is encoded as a [cell](/tvm/serialization/cells). The procedure is:

1. Create a new cell builder with [`begin_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#begin-cell).
1. Set [message flags](), indicated at the line with the single-line [comment](/languages/func/comments) `;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.`.
1. Store the receiving address with [`store_slice`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-slice).
1. Store the amount to send using [`store_coins`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-coins).
1. Finalize the cell with a call to the [`end_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#end-cell) function.

Finally, function [`send_raw_message`](/languages/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) sends the message, where the parameter `64` describes a [sending mode]().

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into [Fift](/languages/fift) assembler code, generating the corresponding bitcode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm/overview).

Developers can use its bitcode, structured as a [bag of cells](/tvm/serialization/boc) like all data in the TON blockchain, to test smart contracts, send messages, or execute it in a local TVM instance.

### Compile with Blueprint

To begin developing and compiling smart contracts, use Blueprint. Read more in the [Blueprint](/ecosystem/blueprint/overview) section.

The following command installs dependencies and creates a template project in the current working directory:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### Compile with original binaries

FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07).

<Aside>
  The last version for the FunC compiler was v2025.07. The FunC compiler is no longer developed. New releases are focused on the [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) compiler.
