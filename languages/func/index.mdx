<Aside>
  The official language of TON Blockchain is Tolk. Other languages are still used, and legacy codebases exist, but Tolk is the only language actively supported. The FunC compiler, for instance, is no longer maintained.
</Aside>

**FunC** is an intermediate-level language used to write smart contracts on TON. It is a domain-specific, statically typed language with C-like syntax.
Example of a FunC method for sending funds:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The method receives two parameters: the [`address`](/foundations/addresses/overview) to send the money to,
and the `amount` to send. It does not return a value, indicated by [`()`](/languages/func/types#tensor-types) to the left of the method name `send_money`.

The method uses the `impure` and `inline` [specifiers](/languages/func/functions#specifiers), which are flags that tell the compiler to process
the method in specific ways.

The method first creates the [message](/foundations/transaction) to send `msg` by using a [cell builder](/tvm/builders-and-slices), since the message is encoded as a [cell](/foundations/serialization/cells). The procedure is:

1. Create a new cell builder with [`begin_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#begin-cell).
1. Set [message flags](/foundations/messages/internal) at the line with the single-line [comment](/languages/func/comments) `;; It sets the message to be non-bounceable.`.
1. Store the receiving address with [`store_slice`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-slice).
1. Store the amount to send using [`store_coins`](/languages/func/stdlib#store-coins).
1. Finalize the cell with a call to the [`end_cell`](/languages/func/stdlib#end-cell) function.

Finally, function [`send_raw_message`](/languages/func/stdlib#send-raw-message) sends the message, where the parameter `64` describes a [sending mode](/foundations/messages/internal).

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into [Fift](/languages/fift) assembler code. The Fift assembler code is then compiled down to
bitcode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/tvm/overview) using the [Fift](/languages/fift) compiler.

Developers can use the compiled bitcode, structured as a [bag of cells](/foundations/serialization/boc) like all data in the TON blockchain, to test smart contracts, send messages, or execute it in a local TVM instance.

### Compile using tooling

To compile FunC files to bitcode, install the `func-js` npm package in your project folder.
It runs in any environment with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v22 or later installed.

The `func-js` package integrates the FunC and [Fift](/languages/fift) compilers
to produce bitcode directly from FunC source code, without manual Fift invocation.

To install `func-js`, run the following command in your project root:

```bash
npm i @ton-community/func-js
```

Next, run the following command to compile a specific FunC file:

```bash
npx func-js ./contract.fc --boc ./output.boc
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC source file in your project root, and `output.boc` is the compiled bitcode output.

<Aside>
  It’s recommended to place the FunC standard library file in your project root. Download `smartcont_lib.zip` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07), extract it, and copy `stdlib.fc` to your project root.
</Aside>

You can also use Blueprint to start a project.
See the [Blueprint](/contract-dev/blueprint/overview) section for setup instructions.

### Compile manually using the binaries

Prebuilt FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07).

**1. Download the corresponding binary for your operating system:**

- Linux: `func-linux-x86_64` (Intel/AMD) and `func-linux-arm64` (Arm64)
- Mac: `func-mac-x86-64` (Intel/AMD) and `func-mac-arm64` (Arm64)
- Windows: `func.exe`

Rename the executable, for example, to `func`, for easier use in the command line, and add it to your system’s `PATH`.

**2. Download the FunC standard library.**

Get the `smartcont_lib.zip` from the same [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.07), extract it, and copy `stdlib.fc` to your project root.

**3. Compile a FunC file to Fift assembler code.**

Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
func contract.fc -o output.fif
```

where `contract.fc` is the FunC file to compile, and `output.fif` is the generated Fift output.

If you need to compile the generated Fift file  `output.fif` further down to TVM bitcode, use the Fift compiler.
See the [Fift](/languages/fift) for download and usage instructions.

<Aside>
  The last FunC compiler version is v2025.07. The FunC compiler is no longer developed. New releases are focused on the [Tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest) compiler.
