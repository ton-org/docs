The _Type Language Binary (TL-B)_ for TON Blockchain is a domain-specific language designed to describe the structure of data in the TON Blockchain.

It is used to define how data is serialized and deserialized, ensuring consistency and interoperability across different components of the TON ecosystem.

Special _TL-B parsers_ can read schemes to deserialize binary data into different objects.

In fact, TL-B is a variant of the original [Type Language (TL)](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/TL) developed for the [Telegram Messenger](https://telegram.org/?setln=en) and adapted to the specific needs of the TON Blockchain.

It is recommended to start by studying the [syntax and semantics of TL-B](/languages/TL-B/syntax-and-semantics), simultaneously exploring each example through a convenient [TL-B online editor](https://ton-community.github.io/tlb-editor/#/main). To further your understanding, we recommend referring to [the page](/languages/TL-B/complex-and-non-trivial-examples) that describes the most complex examples of TL-B schemes.
