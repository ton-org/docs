<Aside>
  The official language of TON Blockchain is [Tolk](/languages/tolk), and all other languages are deemed legacy. That said, you can still use them and contribute to the surrounding tooling or documentation.
</Aside>

Fift is a [stack-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming) general-purpose [tacit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming) programming language optimized for creating, debugging, and managing smart contracts on TON Blockchain.

It has been specifically designed to interact with TON Virtual Machine (TVM) and TON Blockchain. In particular, it offers native support for 257-bit integer arithmetic and cell manipulation, as well as an interface to the Ed25519-based cryptography employed by TON.

Fift also includes a macro assembler for TVM code, which is a common intermediate target of higher-level languages such as [Tolk](/languages/tolk), [FunC](/languages/func), and [Tact](/languages/tact), as well as a common textual bitcode representation of smart contracts. For more examples of the latter, see [various blockchain explorers](/ecosystem/explorers/overview) and disassembled smart contracts.

## Installation

### Interpreter and libraries

Fift interpreter binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel or Arm64), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest).

Make sure to also download the necessary libraries — download and unpack the `smartcont_lib.zip`. The `lib/` folder inside contains standard libraries of Fift, which must be exposed to it when running the interpreter.

Consider the following example installation steps:

<Steps>
  <Step
    title="Download the latest Fift binary"
  >
    <Tabs>
      <Tab
        title="Windows"
      >
        Go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest), download `fift.exe` and place it somewhere on your `PATH`. To see the current state of the `PATH` variable, run `echo $env:PATH` in the PowerShell.
      </Tab>

      <Tab
        title="Linux"
      >
        Go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest), download `fift-linux-x86_64` (64-bit, x86 arch) or `fift-linux-arm64` (64-bit, Arm arch), and place it somewhere on your `$PATH` as `fift`. To see the current state of the `$PATH` variable, run `echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'` in the terminal.
      </Tab>

      <Tab
        title="macOS"
      >
        Go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest), download `fift-mac-x86-64` (64-bit, Intel) or `fift-mac-arm64` (64-bit, Apple Silicon), and place it somewhere on your `$PATH` as `fift`. To see the current state of the `$PATH` variable, run `echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'` in the terminal.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step
    title="Download Fift's standard libraries"
  >
    - Download `smartcont_lib.zip` from the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/latest).
    - Unzip it and extract the contents.
    - Move the extracted `lib/` folder somewhere convenient. You can also place it under a different name.
      - For example, for Linux and macOS, it can be moved to `~/.local/lib/fiftlib`
      - For Windows, to `~/.fiftlib`
  </Step>

  <Step
    title="Run Fift"
  >
    To invoke the Fift binary, you'll need to pass it the standard libraries as such:

    ```shell
    fift -I /path/to/extracted/lib -i Asm.fif
    ```

    If you see errors or red-colored output lines, double-check the placement of the Fift binary and related libraries from previous steps.

    Otherwise, write the following and press "Enter":

    ```fift
    2 2 + .s
    ```

    If you see "4 ok", then Fift has been successfully installed on your machine!

    To learn about other launch options, add the `-h` flag by the end of the prior Fift invocation command.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  For Linux and macOS, it might be convenient to make an alias as such:

  ```shell
  # Within .bash_aliases or .zsh_aliases
  alias fift="/path/to/fift -I /path/to/extracted/lib -i Asm.fif"
  ```

## Getting started

Here is a simple `Hello, World!` example written in Fift:

```fift
."Hello, World!"
```

When [executed with `fift` binary](#installation), it produces the following output:

```txt
Hello, World! ok
```

There, `ok` means successful end of execution of the given code snippet.

<Aside
  type="caution"
>
  When things go awry, there may still be an `ok` by the end, albeit prefixed with several red lines of cryptic-looking stack traces. Those are how Fift reports errors, and this is one of the major reasons why Fift is considered a legacy language.

  **Any errors encountered during execution clear the stack!**

  Hence, to actually know what happened, one needs to preemptively check stack contents. For that, use the ["printf debugging"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging#printf_debugging) approach with the `.s` word — it dumps current stack contents to the console without modifying the stack.

  ```fift
  "Hello, " .s
  // "Hello, "

  "World!" .s
  // "Hello, " "World!"

  $+
  // "Hello, World!"

  type
  // Hello, World! ok
  // Now, the stack is clear.
  ```

## Educational materials

### Whitepapers

<Aside>
  While most of the information described there holds some truth, the `fiftbase.pdf` whitepaper is still considered legacy due to a lack of updates and gradual integration of its contents into actual documentation pages.

  However, it is the most exhaustive reference manual on Fift to date, so you can still use it to learn a lot about Fift.
