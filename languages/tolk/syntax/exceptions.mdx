Tolk supports exceptions and handling them with `try catch`. If an exception is not caught, the program terminates with `errCode`.

In [TVM](/tvm/overview), exceptions are numbers. There is no `Error` class or exception hierarchy, only [exit codes](/tvm/exit-codes).

## Error codes

A common pattern is to define a constant for each exception that a contract may produce. Place them in a separate file such as `errors.tolk`:

```tolk
const ERR_LOW_BALANCE = 200
const ERR_SIGNATURE_MISMATCH = 201
```

`enum` can be used:

```tolk
enum ErrCode {
    LowBalance = 200,
    SignatureMismatch,    // implicitly 201
}
```

Use these constants in `throw` and related statements.

  Lower values are [reserved](/tvm/exit-codes) by TVM. Larger ones are more gas-expensive.

## `throw` statement

To throw an exception unconditionally:

```tolk
throw ERR_CODE;
```

Non-constant expressions such as `throw someVariable` are supported but not recommended. It works, but the compiler cannot determine possible error codes and therefore cannot provide a correct ABI for external callers.

An exception can carry an argument:

```tolk
throw (ERR_CODE, errArg);
```

The argument is available in `catch` and must be a TVM primitive, not a tuple nor a tensor.

## `assert` statement

An `assert` is a shorthand for "throw if a condition is not satisfied". It is commonly used when parsing user input:

```tolk
assert (msg.seqno == storage.seqno) throw E_INVALID_SEQNO;
assert (msg.validUntil > blockchain.now()) throw E_EXPIRED;
```

- The long form `assert (condition) throw ERR_CODE` is preferred.
- The short form `assert (condition, ERR_CODE)` exists but is not recommended.

A condition must be a boolean or an integer; it is `true` if non-zero. It is equivalent to:

```tolk
if (!condition) {
    throw ERR_CODE;
}
```

## TVM implicit throws

During contract execution, TVM may throw runtime exceptions. For example:

- `slice.loadInt(8)` when the slice is empty.
- `builder.storeRef(cell)` when the builder already has 4 references.
- `tuple.push(value)` when the tuple already has 255 elements.
- an out-of-gas exception, which may occur at any point.

## `try catch` statement

`catch` is used to handle runtime errors. The syntax follows:

```tolk
try {
    // ...
} catch (errCode) {
    // errCode is `int`
}
```

- Use the short form `catch { ... }` when `errCode` is not needed.
- Use the long form `catch (errCode, arg)` when the exception may carry an argument produced by `throw (errCode, arg)`. If the exception was thrown as `throw errCode`, the argument is `null`.

```tolk
try {
    throw (ERR_LOW_BALANCE, 555);
} catch (errCode, arg) {
    val data = arg as int;    // 555
}
```

  Any error inside a `try` block reverts all changes made within. TVM restores local variables and control registers to the state they had before entering `try`.
  
  However, gas counters and TVM codepage settings are **not** rolled back. Gas is always spent.
