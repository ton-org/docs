## Variable declaration inside `match`

```tolk
type Pair2 = (int, int)
type Pair3 = (int, int, int)

fun getPair2Or3(): Pair2 | Pair3 { /* ... */ }

fun demo() {
    match (val v = getPair2Or3()) {
        Pair2 => return v.0 + v.1,
        Pair3 => throw v.0 + v.1 + v.2,
    }
}
```


Familiar with Rust's `enum` and `match`?
You may notice that match is very similar, but `enum` in Tolk hold only integers. Union types are more general and powerful.
