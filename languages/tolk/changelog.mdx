## v0.6

The first public release.

Tolk is a fork of FunC with iterative improvements. In 2024, a pull request for [FunC v0.5.0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1026) was submitted together with a roadmap for further development. Instead of merging it, it was forked.

Tolk was first announced at [TON Gateway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frq-HUYGdbI) in 2024-11.
The released version is v0.6, indicating its relation to the FunC v0.5.
