## v1.2

1. Breaking change: `address` is now "internal only" ([details and migration](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1886))
1. Rich bounces: not 256 bits, but the full body on bounce
1. Cheap builder-to-slice, `StateInit`, and address composition
1. Compilation errors significantly improved
1. Anonymous functions supported
1. Borrow checker and other stuff related to undefined behavior

## v1.1

1. `map<K, V>` — a convenient zero-overhead wrapper over TVM dictionaries
1. `enum` — group numeric constants into a distinct type
1. `private` and `readonly` fields in structures
1. Enhanced overload resolution and partial specialization

## v1.0

1. The magic `lazy` keyword — lazy loading, partial loading, partial updating
1. Auto-detect and inline functions at the compiler level
1. Various peephole optimizations for gas efficiency
1. `onInternalMessage` and `onBouncedMessage`, TVM 11 support
1. Custom pack/unpack serializers for custom types

## v0.99

1. Universal `createMessage`
1. Universal `createExternalLogMessage`
1. Sharding — calculate addresses "close to another contract"

## v0.13

1. Auto-packing to/from cells/builders/slices
1. Type `address`
1. Lateinit variables
1. Defaults for parameters

## v0.12

1. Structures `struct A { ... }`
1. Generics `struct<T>` and `type<T>`
1. Methods `fun Point.getX(self)`
1. Rename stdlib functions to short methods

## v0.11

1. Type aliases `type NewName = <existing type>`
1. Union types `T1 | T2 | ...`
1. Pattern matching for types
1. Operators `is` and `!is`
1. Pattern matching for expressions
1. Semicolon for the last statement in a block can be omitted

## v0.10

1. Fixed-width integers: `int32`, `uint64`, etc. [Details](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1559)
1. Type `coins` and function `ton("0.05")`
1. `bytesN` and `bitsN` types (backed by slices at TVM level)
1. Replace `"..."c` postfixes with `stringCrc32("...")` functions
1. Support `0b...` number literals along with `0x...`
1. Trailing comma support

## v0.9

1. Nullable types `int?`, `cell?`, etc.; null safety
1. Standard library (asm definitions) updated to reflect nullability
1. Smart casts, like in TypeScript in Kotlin
1. Operator `!` (non-null assertion)
1. Code after `throw` is treated as unreachable
1. The `never` type

## v0.8

1. Syntax `tensorVar.0` and `tupleVar.0` (both for reading and writing)
1. Allow `cell`, `slice`, etc. to be valid identifiers (not keywords)

## v0.7

1. Under the hood: refactor compiler internals; AST-level semantic analysis kernel
1. Under the hood: rewrite the type system to static typing
1. Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch
1. Generic functions `fun f<T>(...)` and instantiations like `f<int>(...)`
1. The `bool` type; type casting via `value as T`

## v0.6

The first public release. Here are some notes about its origin:

## Tolk is a fork of FunC, iteratively improved

For years, FunC was the primary language for TON.
It gave complete control over the TVM — and if you mastered it, it gave you power.
But its peculiar syntax made onboarding difficult for many.

Initially, the plan was to improve FunC itself.
The goal was simple: to make it more familiar to developers coming from TypeScript, Rust, or Go — without losing any efficiency.

In 2024, a pull request [FunC v0.5.0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1026) was submitted — along with a roadmap for further improvements.

But instead of merging it, the decision was made: **to fork**.
To leave FunC untouched. As it is. As it always was.
And to create a new language under a completely new name.

At the TON Gateway in November 2024, Tolk was first announced to the public. The video is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frq-HUYGdbI).

The first released version of Tolk was **v0.6** — a metaphor for the **FunC v0.5** that could have been but never was.
