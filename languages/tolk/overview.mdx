**Tolk** is a statically typed language designed for TON smart contracts.

It provides declarative structures, automatic cell serialization, first-class message handling, and a modern development experience.

The language compiles to TVM (TON virtual machine) with zero overhead and full control over execution.

```tolk
type AllowedMessage = CounterIncrement | CounterReset

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    val msg = lazy AllowedMessage.fromSlice(in.body);
    match (msg) {
        CounterIncrement => { ... }
        CounterReset => { ... }
    }
}

get fun currentCounter() {
    val storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.counter;
}
```

## Key features

Tolk offers high-level readability while remaining low-level in nature:

- a robust type system to express any cell layout in TON
- lazy loading: unused fields are skipped automatically
- unified message composition and deployment
- a gas-efficient compiler targeting the Fift assembler
- friendly tooling and IDE integration

<Aside type="tip">
  Tolk is fully compatible with existing TON standards and contracts.

## Tolk is a replacement for FunC

Tolk started as an evolution of FunC and is now the recommended language for TON smart contracts.

If you are migrating from FunC:

- Look through [benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench): notice **30–50% lower gas fees**.
- Scan the page [Tolk vs FunC](/languages/tolk/from-func/tolk-vs-func) to get the overall picture.
- Use the [FunC-to-Tolk converter](/languages/tolk/from-func/converter) to migrate existing projects.

## Quick start

1. Run the command:

   ```bash
   npm create ton@latest
   ```

1. Enter a project name and choose "simple counter contract".

1. Follow the ["Your first smart contract"](/contract-dev/first-smart-contract) article
   to get explanations.
