The [converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk) allows any FunC project to be transformed into Tolk with a single command:

```bash
npx @ton/convert-func-to-tolk contracts
```

This is a syntax-level converter that assists in migrating contracts to Tolk. It rewrites FunC code with one-to-one semantics and emits a Tolk version of the contract that remains close to the FunC original.

Example input: [jetton-minter.fc](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk/blob/master/tests/inout/jetton-minter.fc).<br />
Example output: [jetton-minter.tolk](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk/blob/master/tests/inout/jetton-minter.fc.tolk).

The converted contract does not use modern Tolk features such as structures, auto-serialization, or clean message composition. After some manual fixes, it compiles, runs, and passes tests.

If a contract does not compile after conversion, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk). It contains common issues and provides ways to fix them.

## Refactoring

- Use the modern [`onInternalMessage`](/languages/tolk/features/message-handling#oninternalmessage).
- Extract a [`Storage` struct](/languages/tolk/features/contract-storage) with `toCell` and `fromCell`.
- Refactor incoming messages into [structs](/languages/tolk/syntax/structures-fields#serialization-prefixes-and-opcodes) with 32-bit opcodes – incrementally, one message at a time.
- Define a union of possible messages and match it using [`lazy`](/languages/tolk/features/lazy-loading).
- Extract outgoing messages into structs and [send](/languages/tolk/features/message-sending) them.

  Keeping tests passing throughout the refactoring process ensures safe, incremental modernization without breaking functionality.

## Examples

[Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench) repository contains contracts migrated from FunC, preserving the original logic and passing the same tests. To see how each contract was rewritten step by step, use the Git history.
