Tolk has the following types:

- [numbers](/languages/tolk/types/numbers) — `int`, `int32`, `uint64`, `coins`, and others.
- [boolean](/languages/tolk/types/booleans) — `true` and `false`.
- [address](/languages/tolk/types/address) — `internal`, `external`, and `none`.
- [cells](/languages/tolk/types/cells) — containers with up to 1023 bits of data and up to 4 references to other cells, plus the cell manipulation primitives of TVM: [builders and slices](/tvm/builders-and-slices).
- [structures](/languages/tolk/types/structures) — multiple fields grouped into one entity.
- [generics](/languages/tolk/types/generics) — any struct can be generic `<T>`.
- [enums](/languages/tolk/types/enums) — distinct types containing integer variants.
- [nullable types](/languages/tolk/types/nullable) — `null` safety and safe casts.
- [union types](/languages/tolk/types/unions) — variables holding one of several possible values.
- [tensors](/languages/tolk/types/tensors) — multiple values placed sequentially on the stack.
- [tuples](/languages/tolk/types/tuples) — multiple values stored in a single TVM tuple.
- [maps](/languages/tolk/types/maps) — key-value dictionaries.
- [callables](/languages/tolk/types/callables) — first-class functions.
- [`void` and `never`](/languages/tolk/types/void-never) — both represent the absence of a value.

To make an interchangeable alias for an existing type, including structural types, there are [type aliases](/languages/tolk/types/aliases).

Smart contracts run on a stack-based virtual machine, [TVM](/tvm/overview), which imposes specific rules on how values are represented at runtime. For example, there is no distinct type for [strings](/languages/tolk/types/strings) — they are not native to TVM and thus are emulated using slices.

All on-chain data and communication rely entirely on [cells](/languages/tolk/types/cells), so the type system focuses on binary serialization and clear data relationships:

- [Type checks and casts](/languages/tolk/types/type-checks-and-casts) covers casting with the unsafe `as` operator.
- [TVM stack representation](/languages/tolk/types/overall-tvm-stack) summarizes how types map to the TVM stack.
- [Serialization](/languages/tolk/types/overall-serialization) describes how types serialize and relate to [TL-B](/languages/tl-b/overview).
