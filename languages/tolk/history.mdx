When Tolk was first conceived, the idea was simple: What if we had a language for TON that was **low-level and efficient** but **felt more familiar** to developers coming from TypeScript, Rust, or Go?

FunC gave complete control over the TVM — and if you mastered it, it gave you power. But its Lisp-like syntax and functional style made onboarding difficult for many.

Tolk began as an experiment: to maintain efficiency while changing the interface. There are no parentheses and no prefix notation, just clean types, structs, pattern matching, and a modern toolchain.

Since then, Tolk has grown far beyond just being **easier FunC**. It now offers:
- a powerful type system,
- automatic serialization,
- idiomatic message composition,
- and better performance — not despite abstraction, but thanks to it.

Today, Tolk is not an experiment — it's a production-ready replacement for FunC.

## How Tolk was born

In June 2024, I submitted a pull request: [FunC v0.5.0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1026) — along with a roadmap for how FunC could be improved, syntactically and semantically.

But instead of merging it, we made a decision: **To fork**. To leave FunC untouched. As it is. As it always was. And to create a new language driven by a fresh and new name.

Over the next several months, I worked on Tolk privately, implementing not just syntax changes, but a fully redesigned architecture — including an internal AST representation that FunC never had.

On the TON Gateway in Dubai in November 2024, I gave a speech presenting Tolk to the public. The video is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frq-HUYGdbI).

The very first pull request: [Tolk Language: next-generation FunC](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1345).

The first released version of Tolk was **v0.6** — a metaphor for the **FunC v0.5** that could have been but never was.

## Meaning of the name "Tolk"

**Tolk** is a wonderful word. 

In English, it sounds like *talk*. And after all, what do we use a language for? To talk. To talk to computers. 

In all Slavic languages, the root *tolk* and the phrase *"to have tolk"* means "to make sense"; "to have deep internals".

But actually, **TOLK** is an abbreviation. You know, that TON is **The Open Network**. By analogy, TOLK is **The Open Language K**.   

What is K, you might ask? Maybe, it's *kot* — the nickname of Nikolay Durov? Or Kolya? Kitten? Kernel? Kit? Knowledge? The correct answer is none of these. The K stands for nothing. It's open. *The Open Letter K*
