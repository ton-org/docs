A node is a server running TON blockchain software. It stores the chain state, verifies blocks and transactions, and propagates new data to other nodes and clients.

This matters when deciding whether to rely on a public API or run infrastructure, and when tracing how a wallet action becomes an on-chain transaction.

## What a node does

A _full node_ keeps the latest blockchain state and relays blocks and messages across the peer-to-peer network. A _validator_ is a full node that participates in consensus and produces blocks. Many full nodes also expose a _liteserver_ endpoint so wallets and apps can query data or submit messages without running a full node themselves.

TON also has _lite clients_. They do not store chain state locally. Instead, they request the data they need from liteserver-enabled full nodes.

## Node types and roles

- **Full node** — stores the latest state and propagates blocks and messages. See [Node roles and modes](/ecosystem/node/overview).
- **Archive node** — a full node that keeps the entire history for analytics and explorers. See [Node roles and modes](/ecosystem/node/overview).
- **Validator node** — produces blocks and participates in consensus. See [Running a validator](/ecosystem/node/run-validator).
- **Liteserver** — a mode that exposes a gateway for lite clients and APIs. See [Interacting with TON nodes](/ecosystem/node/overview#interacting-with-ton-nodes).

## Who runs nodes

- **Validators** — stake Toncoin, participate in consensus, and produce blocks.
- **Infrastructure providers** — run full nodes and liteservers to back APIs.
- **Explorers and indexers** — run archive nodes to serve historical data.
- **Community operators** — add connectivity and redundancy to the network.

## How apps reach the network

Wallets and dApps act as lite clients: they do not keep chain state locally and instead connect to an [API provider](/ecosystem/api/overview) or a liteserver gateway. The gateway forwards requests to full nodes. Validators are the subset of nodes that finalize new blocks, and the results propagate back through the network.

## Run your own node (optional)

Use public APIs for prototypes and light workloads. Run a full node when an app needs guaranteed uptime or direct access to the network.
